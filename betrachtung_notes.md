# Notes on Betrachtung

__Hypothesis:__ in his work on _Betrachtung_, Kafka is actually trying to translate tropes and devices drawn from film (montage) into syntactic features.

## A list of facts and ideas

1. Betrachtung is a series of 18 short stories written between 1904 and 1912 and published in 1912.
1. Betrachtung means "vision" and, of course, "contemplation"; it is the space between observing and thinking.
1. Here are some observations about each of the short stories:
    1. __Children in the lane__ (Kinder auf der Landstraße):
> Transference from narrator to subject through sight and perspective; I become you since you I am seeing what you are seeing.
    1. __Unmasking a confidence trickster__ (Entlarvung eines Bauernfängers)
> The imagined interiors; static street, dynamic interiors; the revealing smile - a detail that only psychoanalysis or cinema could spot, at least according to Benjamin (cinema taught us how to break a human countenance into its constitutive parts).
    1. __The spur-of-the-moment stroll__ (Der Plötzliche Spaziergange)
> Motion becomes syntax; motion is visual and it becomes syntactic. A sequence of "wenn" subordinates, interrupted by a syntactical variation - "und wenn" - and followed by a symmetrical sequence of "wenn" subordinates; they are again interrupted by "-- dann ist". Syntax is the device which, like vision, allows for motion.
    1. __Decisions__ (Entschlüsse)
> A short vision of social motion and arrest. Again, attention to the micro-gesture (Benjamin). No more to add at this point.
    1. __The excursion into the mountains__ (Der Ausflug ins Gebirge)
> This short monologue, the speaker again achieves a sort of visual motion. I believe that, in this case, the effect is accomplished through the use of a spatial preposition - that transparent __ins__. "Natürlich __ins__ Gebirge, wohin denn sonst?" _A possible question_: what would be the most appropriate preposition for _Gebirge_? Wouldn't we say __onto__ and not __into__ the mountains? "Die Hälse werden im Gebirge frei! Es ist ein Wunder, daß wir nicht singen!"
    1. __The bachelor's lot__ (Das Unglück des Junggsellen)
> Combination of the monologue on bizarre habits, the shifts in perspective obtained through reciprocal observations, and the experiments on motion and stasis. Note how reciprocal observations have the tendency to feature a sort of __enframing__ between them: in this case, the open door of the room. The last paragraph is an interesting __volta__, which needs further analysis: is this a sudden embodiment of a fantasy, or a hallucinatory reversal? This is a fully blown experiment on sight, imagination and perception - the final "clap" ("mit der Hand zu schlagen") is an awakening gesture addressed to the reader, as if one had lingered so long in the projection into one's future, that the very projection may suddenly become a fact.
    1. __The businessman__ (Der Kaufmann)
> Well-known mode in Kafka: a monologue about a character who unveils the strangeness of his habits. Very interesting passage on the first page (26) "...all I can do is go home, because my face and hands are soiled and sweaty, my clothes are stained and dusty, I am wearing my working cap, and my boots bear the scratches of packing-case nails. At such times, I walk as if wave-borne, clicking the fingers of both hands and, as children pass, stroking their hair." How can this constitute a first-person perspective? We can see him walking - the detail of his fingers clicking; and then we become him and his hands - we see his hands as if they were ours - as he caresses the child's hair. This is a short story about subjectivity - about seeing oneself: (27) "...I prop myself on my knees to look in the narrow mirror. As the lift begins its ascent I say: Be still all of you, step back, if you will, into the shade of the trees [...] I speak with my teeth." The existence of the mirror - the problem of the mirror - the gaze into the mirror. These spaces, this microscopical spaces of the self, become the immensity { * * * } Contemplation as the observation of the other attempted to become the other, or attempted to better understand the self; the contemplation of the self. __A broader consideration__ this is a book full of _doors_ and _staircases_ (but all of Kafka is); Kafka the collector of dreamscapes. 
    1. __Wool-gathering at the window__ (Zerstreutes hinausschaun)
> A mysterious thing. The attempt to capture an instant is evident - an instant of transition between two irretrievable moments, before and after. **This morning** the sky was *grey*; **now** one is surprised and leans one's cheek against the window catch. The *light of the sun* against a child-like girl. There is, of course, an inversion: we had *shadow* **before**, we have *sunlight* **now**; but the face of the child is *bright* **now** and will be **shadowed** soon - it is being shadowed now by the "man coming up behind her". **Then** the man has gone past, and the child's face is ***really** bright*. We cannot see an important moment - we cannot see the shadow.
        - sky:				
		      - _This morning_	: __grey__
		      - _now_: __sun-light_
	    - child's face
	           - _before_: __bright__
               - _soon?_: __shadowed__
               - _then_: __really__ __bright__ ("das Gesicht des Kindes ist ganz hell")
    1. __The way home__ (Der Nachhausweg)
> Unbelievably fitting. This is a perfect instance of first person subjective: "I stride along and my speed is the speed ("und mein Tempo ist das Tempo") of this side of the street". Beautiful - how does motion affect, inform this description? How does syntactic - and visual - motion transmit the feeling of "der Luft nach dem Gewitter" (the air after the storm), and the little afterthought of the static room ("ein wenig nachdenklich")? Motion becomes syntax, and it becomes a feeling, an understanding of time.
    1. __Passers-by__ (Die Vorüberlaufenden)
> The title would in itself be worthy of attention, with its peculiar combination of prepositions: _vorüberlaufen_. The specificity of a motion. __Wenn__ is the first word: how does this _wenn_ specifically work in Kafka? How does it __push__ the reader to an imaginative compulsion? How is __imagination__ motion? Imagimotion. Imagimotion. "Wenn man in einer Nacht" - pushing the reader into the night, asking the reader to enter the night; picturing this open night in front of the reader, absorbing the reader - "durch eine Gasse spaziergeht" - another preposition: ins and then durch; ins is a projection into the future, durch is the shape of the present, is watching the street unfold in front of our eyes, for our eyes -, und ein Mann, - two commas isolate this subject and its conjunction - it is initially a static presence - von weitem schon sichtbar - again, the visible is static - but - that "von weitem", as if we had to focus, as if the sight were still blurry and we needed to better look at what is distant; a long dash -- and the word, __the word__ "denn": how do these "wenn" and "denn" create syntactic breaks that, in their strength, evoke the function of montage? This -denn- is another point of view: the street in front of us and the moon in the sky.
        - This small piece deserves a full close reading. It is gorgeous.
    1. __For jockeys to ponder__ (Zum Nachdenker für Herrenreiter)
    1. __The window on the street__ (Das Gassenfenster)
> Exemplary; little words to spend about this. Again, the convergence of perspectives; again the ekphrastic, projective moment outside of the self, mirroring the self. We are watching the watcher, we are becoming the watcher. The norm: usually paying attention to a small detail about the observer - "his head tilted back slightly" - and then appropiating his point of view - what he sees outside of his window. This final moment of incorporation of that subjectivity with the one outside of the window is a moment of incorporation of the reader within that represented personality - as he becomes them - and the universe -, we become him.
    1. __The passenger__ (Der Fahrgast)
> In any case, pure genius. This is photography - a clear example of stasis in motion, of ekphrasis; it is a denied moment of motion: the author is not allowed to follow his imagination behind that ear, along that shadow. "Ich fragte mich damals: Wieso kommt es, daß sie den Mund geschlossen hält und nichts dergleichen sagt?" Penetration into the detail allows us for a brief quotation from Benjamin; the whole short story is an odd experiment of static perception in a moveable setting (relativity).
    1. __Dresses__ (Kleider)
    A mirror in this one.
    1. __The rebuff__ (Die Abweisung)
    An imaginary game of hypothesis. Mostly dialogic. Interesting connection with _Der Fahrgast_ (the woman is given a voice).
    1. __Wanting to be a Red Indian__ (Wunsch, Indianer zu werden)
> This is, without a doubt, a short piece about cinema. About subjectivity as we have defined it: how sight is appropiation. Here an analysis of syntax would be fruitful. I also think that we should start considering a computational lexical analysis: density of "wenn" and "denn", positioning of conjunctions and fragmentation of commas and dashes. A hypothetical sentence is, by necessity, a vision.
    1. __The trees__ (Die Bäume)
> A small image, somehow hard to decipher (it introduces the elaborate fantasy of the final short story). Does syntax intervene here - play a role here?
    1. __Unhappiness__ (Unglücklichsein)
> Short apparition of a child ghost. Dialogue. Something could be said about how dialogue is antithetical to motion and sight; dialogue as the paralisis of motion and sight - as the embodiment of stasis itself.

##A list of problems
1. What is happening with _photography_? 
> I guess that the real question is: what is Kafka generally doing with __different media__; is he trying to invent a new medium through literature - by exploiting the inherent devices of literature?                         >> My thesis would of course be __yes__.
1. We honestly need to find a useful resource to describe and distinguish the different devices used to reproduce stillness, motion, depth - space. The __lenses__.
1. What are we trying to say by this, in any case? We are trying to say that this book is about the appropriation of a stranger's perspective; we are trying to say that in this book literature function as the device that allows us to see what someone else is seeing - think about Spivak and the cleaning people: literature allows us to see beyond what we are used to see.
1. There are also potential considerations about time, of course; Kafka's awareness of the impossibility of cinema - and photography - to capture an evanescent moment between past and future - better, between past and present - present itself, perhaps? No, not present itself - what then?
1. Question: is there a thematic progression in __Betracthung__? Is there any way in which the observer of __Betrachtung__ changes, evolves, improves?
1. This imaginative capacity that __pushes me forward__ in time and in space; and this break - this break - this break: what is this break? Is it editing, montage? I see myself doing - and there I am, myself doing - let us look at a character sitting on his sofa, imagining a trip to the mountains - break - and there we see him, in the mountains. And it is enough to say it "ins Gebirge" - to picture the mountains, to be pushed against the mountains.
1. Vision is a hypothesis; literature is the visionary hypothesis of being someone else.
1. __Update__: _11/26/14_ Inspiring talk by Spivak; potential integration of the __mirror stage__, and the mirror as a space of negotiation of subjectivities. The mirror becoming an open window - the contemplation of the other becoming a contemplation of the self, an incorporation of the self; an interpretation of the self. Imaginative _push_ as a way of transforming that other life into mine, into something resembling my own.
1. __Update__: _12/4/14_ Then there is the _realist_ connection, which I believe should be at least hinted at. That is, the two technologies were developing at the same time - stereoscopic images __and__ realism are a parallel exploration of the same problem - a parallel solution to the same question - how to convey vision? Manet, Courbet and Flaubert on the same page; absorbed by Kafka; in the meanwhile, photography and the stereoscopic image, absorbed by Kafka. How is he addressing these two currents, these two contrasting genealogies? And do they pose an inevitable selection - an inescapable option?
---
1. __THE SYNTAX OF GAZE IS THE HYPOTHETICAL SENTENCE__. _HYPOTHESIS IS THE SYNTACTICAL FORM OF GAZE - OF THE POV PERSPECTIVE/FRAME._ __HOLD TO THIS THOUGHT.__ IT IS CRUCIAL.
1. The hypothetical sentence is the stasis of the observer facing the dynamism of the observed. The hypothetical sentence is precisely this passivity, the very denial of actual activity that is entailed in the _if_ - when I utter the _If_ of _If I were_ I am there but I am also outside, I am the utterer and the observer of my own thought, _I have placed myself outside of my own thought. Of the field of vision. I am sitting on my couch while picturing a throng of Red Indians riding fast in the prairie - I am there with them, and yet I am outside of that space, I am in motion and yet I am still, sitting right here. _IF I WERE THERE_ I AM NOT. I am on the couch - I am the reposed observer - motion is outside of me, it is the shape of my thought, the thought triggered by the __IF__.

1. __N.B.:__ do not be tempted by panning movements in your argument; panning was, in any case, extremely rare. The sort of liberty that you are imagining for, say, your description of the _Fahrgast_ is entirely hypothetical. There were, however, experiments with vehicles.
