## On cinema in Germany

## Ideas (articles)
1. Michiel Rys, _Turning the Reel_ in "Image [&] Narrative", Vol. 15, No. 2 (2014)
 > There is a book about _Joycean Frames: Film and the Fiction of James Joyce_, by Thomas L. Burkdall. It should be checked out. In Rys' words: "there are noticeable connections between his writing, film theory (e. g. Eiesenstein) and film practice (e.g. the use of techniques such as close-up). [And, of course, we should ask what the connection could be between _close-up_ and _ekphrasis_. Also, why are we so obsessed with hypotyposis?]
 > As we read here, Kafka visited a _Kaiserpanorama_ in February 1911. He imagined a conflation between __cinema and stereoscope__ (127 in Rys).
 > Nobody mentions either: 1) the movies that Kafka might have seen; 2) the _first person perspective_ as a potential bridge between the two devices.
