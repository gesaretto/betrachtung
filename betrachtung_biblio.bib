Thoughts.

"Since the 1920s, when film theorists began to realize what __editing__ can achieve, it has been the most widely discussed film technique. This hasn't been all to the good. Some writers have mistakenly found in editing the key to good cinema (or even to _all_ cinema). Yet many film scenes don't use editing extensively. As we saw in the last chapter, some films consist of very few shots. Some major films of the 1910s, such as Victor Stiöström's _Ingeborg Holm_, consist largely of single-take scenes; these shape our experience by subtle manipulations of mise-en-scene." (218) "Still we can see why editing has exercised such an enormous fascination. It's very powerful."

"Once the material is selected, the editor joins the shots, the end of one to the beginning of another. The most common join is the __cut__. A cut provides an instantaneous change from one shot to another. Other methods of joining shots produce more gradual changes. A __fade-out__ gradually darkens the end of a shot to black, and a __fade-in__ lightens a shot from black. A __dissolve__ briefly superimposes the end of shot A and the beginning of shot B [...]. In a __wipe__, shot B replaces shot A by means of a boundary line moving across the screen [...]." (219)

"Editing offers the filmmaker four basic areas of choice and control:
1. Graphic relations between shot A and shot B
2. Rhythmic relations between shot A and shot B
3. Spatial relations between shot A and shot B
4. Temporal relations between shot A and shot B"

1. is a sort of isomorphism, of course; alliteration, rhyme, and any sort of paronomasia work in this way. It is the similarity between the signifier that creates meaning; it is irrational, aesthetic, and yet - it is use to suggest connections that would be imperceivable from a purely logical standpoint. More on this.

"Graphics may be edited to achieve smooth continuity or abrupt contrast. The filmmaker may link shots by close graphic similarities, thus making a __graphic match__. Shapes, colors, overall composition, or movement in shot A may be picked up in the composition of shot B. (222) [...] Such precise graphic matching is rare. A looser graphic continuity from shot A to shot B is typical of most narrative cinema [...]. The director will usually strive to keep the main point of interest roughly constant across the cut, to maintain the overall lighting level, and to avoid strong color clashes from shot to shot. [...] (223)

2. rythm; another prosodic aspect - having to do with the signifier; but also a syntactic aspect, happening at the level of punctuation and structure. Quantitative metrical patterns. Poetical unities (stanzas, tiradas).

"Every shot is of a certain length, with its series of frames consuming a certain amount of time onscreen. Modern film [...] typically runs 24 or 25 frames per second. Modern video formats run at approximately 24. 25, 30 or 48 frames per second. A shot can be as short as a single frame, or it may be thousands of frames long, running for many minutes when projected. The filmmaker can adjust the lengths of any shot in relation to the shots around it. That choice taps into the _rythmic_ potential of editing." (226)
 
3. space: this belongs to the signified; it is almost entirely semantic (although, how could a signifier by itself suggest _space_? perhaps a foreign word - perhaps a succession of foreign, apparently meaningless words, might create a sort of concentrated geography of Babel?).

"Editing can control graphics and rythm, but it can also construct film sapace. When early filmmakers discovered this, they seemed giddy with their godlike power. 'I am builder', wrote Soviet documentarist Dziga Vertov. 'I have placed you . . . in an extraordinary room which did not exist until just now when I also created it. In this room there are twelve walls, shot by me in various parts of the world. In bringing together shots of walls and details, I've managed to arrange them in an order that is pleasing."
We can understand why Vertov was elated. Editing permits the filmmaker to juxtapose _any_ two points in space and suggest some kind of relationship between them." (227)

"Although filmmakers had already discovered this editing tactic, film historians called the idea behind it the _Kulesov effect_. In general, that term refers to cutting together portions of space in a way that prompts the spectator to assume a spatial whole that isn't shown onscreen. Most often, this happens because the filmmaker has decided to withhold an establishing shot." (228)

An imaginative effort is obviously required from the viewer - a push to see what is unseen, to imagine what isn't seen.

Thoughts: I don't know where Bordwell defines the idea of __establishing shot__, but it is crucial: you have narrower shots for subjective point of views, and wider shots when the two or more observers, or when the observer and the observed, have to be located in space. That is, narrower shots only give us the details of the process of observation, and are strictly subjective; wider shots are impersonal (objective), and are helpful to locate people in space.

4. Time - again, mostly semantic; implications related to the signifier are marginal (and probably only have to do with the prosodic aspects that we have already analyzed).
This is very basic narratology, by the way.

"Like other film techniques, editing can control the time of the action presented in the film. In a narrative film especially, editing usually contributes to the plot's manipulation of story time. [...] we pointed out three areas in which plot time can cue the spectator to construct the story time: order, duration, and frequency." (228)
"Controlling chronology can affect story-plot relations. We are most familiar with such manipulations in _flashbacks_, which present one or more shots out of their presumed story order. [...] A much rare option for reordering story order is the __flashforward__. Here the editing moves from the present to a future event and then returns to the present."
"Filmmakers may use flashforwards to tease the viewer with glimpses of the eventual outcome of the story action. [...] Such flashforwards create a sense of a narration with a powerful range of story knowledge." (230)
"Filmmakers overwhelmingly present their shots in chronological order, but they are more likely to use editing to alter the _duration_ of story events. __Elliptical editing__ presents an action in such a way that it consumes less time on the screen than it does in the story. THe filmmaker can create an _ellipsis_ in three principal ways. 

"First, there is the _order_ of presentation of events."

"Around 1900-1910, as filmmakers started to explore editing, they tried to arrange their shots so as to tell a story clearly. They developed an approach to editing, supported by specific strategies of cinematography and mise-en-scene, that was based on _narrative continuity_. Their explorations coalesced into a consistent style at the end of the 1910s, and it was embraced by filmmakers around the world." (232)

We keep this as a note on the opening of the amazing _Gone Girl_: "[f]ilmmakers usually adjust the rhythm of the cutting to the scale of the shots. Long shots are left on the screen longer than medium shots, and medium shots are left on longer than close-ups. That gives the spectator more time to take in the broader views, which contain more details." (233)

"When working around the continuity of style, the filmmaker builds the scene's space around what is called the __axis of action__, the _center line_, or the _180* line_. Any action - a person walking, two people conversing, a car racing along a road - can be thought of as occurring along a line or a vector. This axis of action determines a half-circle, or 180* area, where the camera can be placed to present the action. The filmmaker will plan, stage, shoot, and edit the shots so as to maintain the axis of action from shot to shot." (233)

- more grammar:

- __establishing shot__
- __shot/reverse shot__
-__reestablishing shot__

"There's one more fine point with respect to spatial continuity, and it's especially relevant to a film's narration. We have already seen that a camera framing can strongly indicate a character's optical point of view, making the narrator subjective. [...] That example presents a cut from the person looking [...] to what he sees [...]. [...] optical POV is consistent with continuity editing, creating the type of eyeline-match editing known as _point-of-view cutting_.

  Abstract                 = {"Photographs thus uncover what Walter Benjamin calls the 'optical unconscious' of reality (BGS II 371/BSW II 511 - 12)- those details which are not commonly visible to the naked eye and which can acquire a disquieting character, not least because of the element of chance which undermines the photographer's control over the resulting image." (3) 

"Kafka allegedly described himself as an 'Augenmensch' ['visual person', literally 'an eye man'] [...] Indeed, photography's particular fascination for him lay in its ability to open up previously unnoticed realms of reality, thus provoking reflection and interpretation." (3) 

"In Kafka's eyes, photographs offer only a limited and potentially puzzling view of reality, and he is frequently intrigued by what lies beyond the photographic frame." (4) 

- The author apparently provides an excellent introduction to the so-called state of the art in early XX century Prague. -> SHE DOES NOT. 

"Kafka's contemporaries were quick to realize the importance of photography for an understanding of his work. The 'photographic' nature of Kafka's texts was stressed by Sigfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and Theodor W. Adorno, who all discerned a deep affinity between his writings and the medium." (15) 

- Chapter 1 traces the Rezeptiongeschichte of Kafka in his relationship with photography - through Kracauer, Adorno, Benjamin. 

[Discussing Adorno's PoV] "Kafka's texts take the fragmenting effect of photography to a new extreme; having dissolved the familiar unity of reality, they resist the reintegration of its disparate elements itno a new harmonious whole. In Kracauer's reading, then, Kafka's works mobilize a photographic aesthetic of fragmentation, illustrating its disorienting consequences in scenarios which offer no scope for synthesis." 

- A discussion of a studio photograph of young Kafka; nobody seems to answer a crucial question: what is that child looking at? What is that distant gaze focusing on? 

- Chapter 2 is, of course, on cinema. 

"The spectacles of the city and the attractions of mass entertainment provide an inexhaustible source of inspiration for the young writer. Kafka's early diaries recount and illustrate his search for visual technologies which could be productively mobilized for the sake of literary creation. Indeed, encounters with photography, film, and stereoscopy not only yield ample thematic material, but also shape his literary style, as well as inspiring more general reflections about the relationship between vision and writing, literature and technology. Film harbours a particular fascination for Kafka less through particular motifs or storylines than because of its capacity to alter and expand human perception, offering a training ground for new modes of seeing. Yet Kafka's fascination with the vividness and dynamism of this new medium is not, as we shall see, entirely unequivocal. His attraction frequently gives way to an unsettling sense of exposure, and his fascination is intervowen with a latent anxiety: the fear of being conditioned and invaded by such spectacles as the girl in his dream." (36)

"While Kafka's early diaries thus trace his undeniable fascination with the cinema, the ambiguity of these encounters in turn motivates the search for a visual paradigm more conducive to literary exploration. Indeed, it is through an incisive critique of film and its invasive, fragmenting effects that Kafka comes to embrace photography as a more productive and sustainable source of literary inspiration." (36) 

"For all their tangible vividness, the visual sketches and observations that appear throughout Kafka's early diaries are often the result of an intricate process of mediation. Indeed, even where media technologies are not explicitly thematized, they nonetheless provide a perceptual grid through which the encountered reality is experienced and recorded." (36)

"Indeed, Kafka's variation of this anecdote captures more accurately the fascination of early film - the dichotomy between the fast-moving images projected onto the screen and the stillness of an audience which is passively, almost hypnotically, exposed to this spectacle." (37) 

- Beautiful ricompilation of Kafka confronting cinema in the Diaries. Yes, it is exactly as we had expected.

"Kafka's account of a cinema visit in November 1913 betrays a deeply rooted ambivalence:

Im Kino gewesen. Geweint. 'Lolotte'. Der gute Pfarrer [priest]. Das kleine Fahrrad. Die Versöhnung [reconciliation] der Eltern. Maßlose Unterhaltung. Vorher trauriger Film 'Das Unglück im Dock' nachher lustiger 'Endlich allein'. Bin ganz leer und sinnlos, die vorüberfahrende Elektrische [the passing tram] hat mehr lebendingen Sinn. (TB 595)

The titles of the viewed films are juxtaposed with brief references to individual scenes as well as with equally matter-of-fact comments of the writer's own response - a fragmentary account which in turn mirrors the montage style of early film and its dissociating effect on the viewer. As Kafka's entry suggests, the experience of film defies assimilation into a coherent narrative." (38)},
