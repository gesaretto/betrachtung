  Abstract                 = {"Photographs thus uncover what Walter Benjamin calls the 'optical unconscious' of reality (BGS II 371/BSW II 511 - 12)- those details which are not commonly visible to the naked eye and which can acquire a disquieting character, not least because of the element of chance which undermines the photographer's control over the resulting image." (3)
"Kafka allegedly described himself as an 'Augenmensch' ['visual person', literally 'an eye man'] [...] Indeed, photography's particular fascination for him lay in its ability to open up previously unnoticed realms of reality, thus provoking reflection and interpretation." (3)
"In Kafka's eyes, photographs offer only a limited and potentially puzzling view of reality, and he is frequently intrigued by what lies beyond the photographic frame." (4)
- The author apparently provides an excellent introduction to the so-called state of the art in early XX century Prague. -> SHE DOES NOT.
"Kafka's contemporaries were quick to realize the importance of photography for an understanding of his work. The 'photographic' nature of Kafka's texts was stressed by Sigfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and Theodor W. Adorno, who all discerned a deep affinity between his writings and the medium." (15)
- Chapter 1 traces the Rezeptiongeschichte of Kafka in his relationship with photography - through Kracauer, Adorno, Benjamin.
[Discussing Adorno's PoV] "Kafka's texts take the fragmenting effect of photography to a new extreme; having dissolved the familiar unity of reality, they resist the reintegration of its disparate elements itno a new harmonious whole. In Kracauer's reading, then, Kafka's works mobilize a photographic aesthetic of fragmentation, illustrating its disorienting consequences in scenarios which offer no scope for synthesis."
- A discussion of a studio photograph of young Kafka; nobody seems to answer a crucial question: what is that child looking at? What is that distant gaze focusing on?
- Chapter 2 is, of course, on cinema.
"While Kafka's early diaries thus trace his undeniable fascination with the cinema, the ambiguity of these encounters in turn motivates the search for a visual paradigm more conducive to literary exploration. Indeed, it is through an incisive critique of film and its invasive, fragmenting effects that Kafka comes to embrace photography as a more productive and sustainable source of literary inspiration." (36)
"Indeed, Kafka's variation of this anecdote captures more accurately the fascination of early film - the dichotomy between the fast-moving images projected onto the screen and the stillness of an audience which is passively, almost hypnotically, exposed to this spectacle." (37)
- Beautiful ricompilation of Kafka confronting cinema in the Diaries. Yes, it is exactly as we had expected.},
