  Abstract                 = {This book might prove useless for our purposes, although it seems incredibly fun. Thoughts. "Since the 1920s, when film theorists began to realize what __editing__ can achieve, it has been the most widely discussed film technique. This hasn't been all to the good. Some writers have mistakenly found in editing the key to good cinema (or even to _all_ cinema). Yet many film scenes don't use editing extensively. As we saw in the last chapter, some films consist of very few shots. Some major films of the 1910s, such as Victor Stiöström's _Ingeborg Holm_, consist largely of single-take scenes; these shape our experience by subtle manipulations of mise-en-scene." (218) "Still we can see why editing has exercised such an enormous fascination. It's very powerful." "Once the material is selected, the editor joins the shots, the end of one to the beginning of another. The most common join is the __cut__. A cut provides an instantaneous change from one shot to another. Other methods of joining shots produce more gradual changes. A __fade-out__ gradually darkens the end of a shot to black, and a __fade-in__ lightens a shot from black. A __dissolve__ briefly superimposes the end of shot A and the beginning of shot B [...]. In a __wipe__, shot B replaces shot A by means of a boundary line moving across the screen [...]." (219) "Editing offers the filmmaker four basic areas of choice and control: 1. Graphic relations between shot A and shot B 2. Rhythmic relations between shot A and shot B 3. Spatial relations between shot A and shot B 4. Temporal relations between shot A and shot B" 1. is a sort of isomorphism, of course; alliteration, rhyme, and any sort of paronomasia work in this way. It is the similarity between the signifier that creates meaning; it is irrational, aesthetic, and yet - it is use to suggest connections that would be imperceivable from a purely logical standpoint. More on this. "Graphics may be edited to achieve smooth continuity or abrupt contrast. The filmmaker may link shots by close graphic similarities, thus making a __graphic match__. Shapes, colors, overall composition, or movement in shot A may be picked up in the composition of shot B. (222) [...] Such precise graphic matching is rare. A looser graphic continuity from shot A to shot B is typical of most narrative cinema [...]. The director will usually strive to keep the main point of interest roughly constant across the cut, to maintain the overall lighting level, and to avoid strong color clashes from shot to shot. [...] (223) 2. rythm; another prosodic aspect - having to do with the signifier; but also a syntactic aspect, happening at the level of punctuation and structure. Quantitative metrical patterns. Poetical unities (stanzas, tiradas). "Every shot is of a certain length, with its series of frames consuming a certain amount of time onscreen. Modern film [...] typically runs 24 or 25 frames per second. Modern video formats run at approximately 24. 25, 30 or 48 frames per second. A shot can be as short as a single frame, or it may be thousands of frames long, running for many minutes when projected. The filmmaker can adjust the lengths of any shot in relation to the shots around it. That choice taps into the _rythmic_ potential of editing." (226) 3. space: this belongs to the signified; it is almost entirely semantic (although, how could a signifier by itself suggest _space_? perhaps a foreign word - perhaps a succession of foreign, apparently meaningless words, might create a sort of concentrated geography of Babel?). "Editing can control graphics and rythm, but it can also construct film sapace. When early filmmakers discovered this, they seemed giddy with their godlike power. 'I am builder', wrote Soviet documentarist Dziga Vertov. 'I have placed you . . . in an extraordinary room which did not exist until just now when I also created it. In this room there are twelve walls, shot by me in various parts of the world. In bringing together shots of walls and details, I've managed to arrange them in an order that is pleasing." We can understand why Vertov was elated. Editing permits the filmmaker to juxtapose _any_ two points in space and suggest some kind of relationship between them." (227) "Although filmmakers had already discovered this editing tactic, film historians called the idea behind it the _Kulesov effect_. In general, that term refers to cutting together portions of space in a way that prompts the spectator to assume a spatial whole that isn't shown onscreen. Most often, this happens because the filmmaker has decided to withhold an establishing shot." (228) An imaginative effort is obviously required from the viewer - a push to see what is unseen, to imagine what isn't seen. Thoughts: I don't know where Bordwell defines the idea of __establishing shot__, but it is crucial: you have narrower shots for subjective point of views, and wider shots when the two or more observers, or when the observer and the observed, have to be located in space. That is, narrower shots only give us the details of the process of observation, and are strictly subjective; wider shots are impersonal (objective), and are helpful to locate people in space. 4. Time - again, mostly semantic; implications related to the signifier are marginal (and probably only have to do with the prosodic aspects that we have already analyzed). This is very basic narratology, by the way. "Like other film techniques, editing can control the time of the action presented in the film. In a narrative film especially, editing usually contributes to the plot's manipulation of story time. [...] we pointed out three areas in which plot time can cue the spectator to construct the story time: order, duration, and frequency." (228) "Controlling chronology can affect story-plot relations. We are most familiar with such manipulations in _flashbacks_, which present one or more shots out of their presumed story order. [...] A much rare option for reordering story order is the __flashforward__. Here the editing moves from the present to a future event and then returns to the present." "Filmmakers may use flashforwards to tease the viewer with glimpses of the eventual outcome of the story action. [...] Such flashforwards create a sense of a narration with a powerful range of story knowledge." (230) "Filmmakers overwhelmingly present their shots in chronological order, but they are more likely to use editing to alter the _duration_ of story events. __Elliptical editing__ presents an action in such a way that it consumes less time on the screen than it does in the story. THe filmmaker can create an _ellipsis_ in three principal ways. "First, there is the _order_ of presentation of events." "Around 1900-1910, as filmmakers started to explore editing, they tried to arrange their shots so as to tell a story clearly. They developed an approach to editing, supported by specific strategies of cinematography and mise-en-scene, that was based on _narrative continuity_. Their explorations coalesced into a consistent style at the end of the 1910s, and it was embraced by filmmakers around the world." (232) We keep this as a note on the opening of the amazing _Gone Girl_: "[f]ilmmakers usually adjust the rhythm of the cutting to the scale of the shots. Long shots are left on the screen longer than medium shots, and medium shots are left on longer than close-ups. That gives the spectator more time to take in the broader views, which contain more details." (233) "When working around the continuity of style, the filmmaker builds the scene's space around what is called the __axis of action__, the _center line_, or the _180* line_. Any action - a person walking, two people conversing, a car racing along a road - can be thought of as occurring along a line or a vector. This axis of action determines a half-circle, or 180* area, where the camera can be placed to present the action. The filmmaker will plan, stage, shoot, and edit the shots so as to maintain the axis of action from shot to shot." (233) - more grammar: - __establishing shot__ - __shot/reverse shot__ -__reestablishing shot__ "There's one more fine point with respect to spatial continuity, and it's especially relevant to a film's narration. We have already seen that a camera framing can strongly indicate a character's optical point of view, making the narrator subjective. [...] That example presents a cut from the person looking [...] to what he sees [...]. [...] optical POV is consistent with continuity editing, creating the type of eyeline-match editing known as _point-of-view cutting_. Last part of the section: __crosscutting__,},

  Abstract                 = {"The most significant form of visual imagery in the nineteenth century, with the exception of photographs, was the stereoscope. It is easily forgotten now how pervasive was the experience of the stereoscope and how for decades it defined a major mode of experiencing photographically reproduced images. This too is a form whose history has thus far been confounded with that of another phenomenon, in this case photography. [...]" (82) "Although distinct from the optical devices that represented the illusion of movement, the stereoscope is nonetheless part of the same reorganization of the observer, the same relations of knowledge and power, that those devices implied." "The origins of the stereoscope are intertwined with research in the 1820s and 1830s on subjective vision and more generally within the field of nineteenth-century physiology already discussed. The two figures most closely associated with its invention, Charles Wheatstone and SIr David Brewster, had already written extensively on optical illusions, color theory, afterimages and other visual phenomena." "The stereoscope is also inseparable from early nineteenth-century debates about the perception of space, which were to continue unresolved indefinitely. Was space an innate form or was it something recognized through the learning of cues after birth?" (82) "Binocular disparity, the self-evident fact that each eye sees a slightly different image, had been a familiar phenomenon since antiquity. [...] The question that preoccupied researchers was this: given that an observer perceives with each eye a different image, _how_ are they experienced as single or unitary?" (83) "Wheatstone's conclusions in 1833 came out of the successful measurement of binocular parallax, or the degree to which the angle of the axis of each eye differed when focused on the same point. The human organism, he claimed, had the capacity under most conditions to synthetize retinal disparity into a single unitary image." "The relation of the observer to the object is not one of identity but an experience of disjunct or divergent images." "In devising the stereoscope, Wheatstone aimed to simulate the actual presence of a physical object or scene, not to discover another way to exhibit a print or drawing [...]. Painting had been an adequate form of representation, he asserts, but only for images of objects at a great distance. When a landscape is presented to a viewer, 'if those circumstances which would disturb the illusion are excluded', we could mistake the representation for reality. He declares that up to this point in history it is impossible for an artist to give a faithful representation of any _near_ solid object." (84) "What he seeks, then, is a complete equivalence of stereoscopic image and object. Not only will the invention of the stereoscope overcome the deficiencies of painting but also those of the diorama, which Wheatstone singles out." (85) "The stereoscope, on the contrary, provided a form in which "vividness" of effect increased with the apparent proximity of the object to the viewer, and the impression of three-dimensional solidity became greater as the optic axes of each diverged. Thus the desired effect of the stereoscope was not simply likeness, but immediate, apparent _tangibility_. But it is a tangibility that has been transformed into a purely visual experience, of a kind that Diderot could never have imagined." "In the stereoscopic image there is a derangement of the conventional functioning of optical cues. Certain planes or surfaces, even though composed of indications of light or shade that normally designate volume, are perceived as flat; other planes that normally would be read as two-dimensional, such as a fence in a foreground, seem to occupy space aggressively. This stereoscopic relief or depth has no unifying logic or order. If perspective implied a homogeneous and potentially metric space, the stereoscope discloses a fundamentally disunified and aggregate field of disjunct elements. Our eyes never traverse the image in a full apprehension of the three-dimensionality of the entire field, but in terms of a localized experience of separate areas. When we look head-on at a photograph or painting our eyes remain at a single angle of convergence, thus endowing the image surface with an optical unity. The reading or scanning of a stereo image, however, is an accumulation of differences in the degree of optical convergence, thereby producing a perceptual effect of a patchworl of different intensities of relief within a single image. Our eyes follow a choppy and erratic path into is depth: it is an assemblage of local zones of three-dimensionality, zones imbued with a hallucinatory clarity, but which when taken together never coalesce into a homogeneous field." "A range of nineteenth-century painting also manifests some of these features of stereoscopic imagery. Courbet's _Ladies of the VIllage_ (1851), with its much-noted discontinuity of groups and planes, suggests the aggregate space of the stereoscope, as do similar elements of _The Meeting (Bonjour, M Courbet)_ (1854)." (86) "Like the phenakistiscope and other nonprojective optical devices, the stereoscope also required the corporeal adjacency and immobility of the observer. They are part of a nineteenth-century modulation in the relation between eye and optical apparatus. During the seveenteenth and eighteenth centuries that relationship had been essentially metaphoric: the eye and the camera obscura or the eye and the telescope or microscope were allied by a conceptual similarity, in which the authority of an ideal eye remained unchallenged. Beginning in the nineteenth century, the relation between eye and optical apparatus becomes one of metonymy: both were now contiguous instruments on the same plane of operation, with varying capabilities and features." (88) "A crucial feature of these optical devices of the 1830s and 1840s is the undisguised nature of their operational structure and the form of subjection they entail. Even though they provide access to "the real", they make no claim that he real is anything other than a mechanical production. The optical experiences they manifacture are clearly disjunct from the images used in the device." (89)},

  Abstract                 = {An essential piece of information: "Gustave Flaubert's _Sentimental Education_ (1869) [...] was one of Kafka's favourite books" (19) Gentlemen, we are done here. "The diaries' main purpose is not the recording of daily events; rather, they are exercises in observation and reflection [___BETRACHTUNG__]. Kafka comments on his inner state and on his literary work, noting influences and inspirations. In addition, he delves deep into the pre-rational part of his mind when recording dreams, daydreams or semi-conscious thoughts and fantasies." (20) "Inward-looking reflection is one important component of the early diaries, but they are also exercises in observation. Kafka describes the sights and people he encounters in his day-to-day life, but especially on his travels to other parts of Bohemia, to Germany, Italy and France." "Another of Kafka's great interests was photography, although this interest was less practical. While he probably did not own a camera, he was a keen viewer and collector of photographs [...]. As his letters reveal, photographs for Kafka were rarely straightforward, but offered puzzling and at times even alienating perspectives on reality; despite the unsettling nature of photography, however, Kafka contrasted it favourably with another, even more recent, visual medium. On a business trip to the Bohemian town of Friedland, Kafka visited the Kaiser Panorama, a slide show of three-dimensional, or 'stereoscopic', photographs. In his diary, the account of this visit sparks a comparison between film and photography: 'The pictures [are] more alive than in the cinema because they offer the eye all the repose of reality, The cinema communicates the restlessness of its motion to the things pictured in it; the eye's repose would seem to be more important (_D_ 430/_TB_ 937)". Kafka was an avid cinema-goer, and in his diaries he tries to capture particular scenes from his cinema visits, though often these impressions prove to be too fast-moving and elusive. In the early twentieth century, writers took inspiration from the new medium of film, trying to write in a cinematic way, for instance through the literary 'montage' of contrasting images. As Kafka's diary account of the Kaiser Panorama shows, however, he remained sceptical about the medium's literary potential. For him, the static nature of photography was not a weakness but an advantage, as it offered scope for a more contemplative, controlled mode of perception. In order to depict the complexity of modern life, the writer needs to be able to decelerate or even arrest the stream of impressions into distinct images, and this is precisely what Kafka does in his fiction." (21-22) "This process can be traced in 'Wedding Preparations in the Country'. [...] While the earliest version depicts a constantly changing scene, an amalgam of vehicles and people who are sketched out without much detail, in the third version, this fluidity is replaced by a succession of self-contained narrative 'frames'. Anticipating his own comments on the Kaiser Panorama, Kafka 'zooms in' on a few pedestrians, each of whom is given a separate paragraph, but this last version is also the shortest and does not develop beyond the opening scene." (22) [This is pretty much __DUTTLINGER's POV__. We do not need to agree. In fact, we don't see that much of a contrast between the two techniques; the problem is only one: you are either capturing motion (movement, __Unruhe__, hypotyposis) or capturing repose (stasis, Ruhe, ekphrasis). Kafka does both, constantly.] _Meditation_ With _Meditation_ (_Betrachtung_), his first book to be published, Kafka takes stock of his literary achievements to date. Published in 1912, it assembles eighteen short prose texts, the earliest of which date back to at least 1906; four of them are excerpts from 'Description of a Struggle', while others are taken from the diaries. The texts are extremely diverse in form, style and subject matter. While some are short stories in the more conventional sense, others barely have a plot or recognizable characters. The volume's title sums up the two main components of Kafka's early work. The German _Betrachtung_ means 'contemplation' or 'meditation', but also 'observation'. Both meanings are reflected throughout the collection, which contains closely observed scenes alongside more abstract, reflective pieces." [N.B.: Duttlinger focuses on __Wunsch, Indianer zu werden__ and __Die Bäume__, precisely what AH wishes to do in his chapter on Kafka.] On __WIZW__: "the rider abandons spurs, reins and eventually even his horse, moving across a landscape that is barely visible. The wish to _become_ a Red Indian is realized as a process of abstraction, a gradual stripping away of the features that make up this identity. The text uses a realist pretext to get started byt gradually abandons this vehicle as the narrative becomes self-perpetuating. What remains is a sense of pure movement: a movement across space, but also the movement of the text. The smoothness of the 'close-cropped scrub' resembles the blank page over which the pen can glide freely - but as the last realist reference point is abandoned, the text comes to a halt." (24) "'Trees' and 'Wish to Become a Red Indian' exemplify several of the core features of _Meditation_. Many of Kafka's early texts seem straightforward at a first glance, but, like the tree trunks, they have hidden depths. Often events are recounted in the conditional mode, lending them to a hypothetical character, while elsewhere reality seamlessly merges into fantasy. Some texts use the impersonal pronoun 'one' or the collective 'we', thus drawing the reader into their ruminations. Some pieces are left open-ended; in others the ending undermines what has come before. On the whole, _Meditation_ makes for a fragmented and slightly vertiginous reading experience, requiring the reader to reassess his/her position in relation to each individual text." "The stories of _Meditation_ oscillate between movement and stasis. Stationary observers turn into _flâneurs_, whereas characters who have wandered the city return to the quiet of their home. Walking the city is one way of escaping the monotony of life; another escape route leads into the world of fantasy and imagination, but both strategies can be disorienting. Indeed, many of Kafka's protagonists feel uncertain, alienated from themselves and their surrounding." [Precisely AH's point. This is weird.] "A case in point is the protagonist of 'The Passenger' ('Der Fahrgast'), who is 'utterly uncertain of my status in this world, in this city, in my family' (_M_ 12/_DL_ 27). The movement of the tram on which he is travelling embodies this instability - but then the mood changes when his gaze is captured by a girl. She appears 'as distinct to me as if I had run my hands over her' (_M_ 12/_DL_ 27), and what follows is an invasively detailed description of her body. This mood change is typical of Kafka's early writings, where characters are suddenly propelled out of self-consciousness by a sight that captures their attention. The city is a space of encounters, some erotically charged, others more sinister." (25) [KadLS] "In this middle section, the narrative perspective shifts from 'I' to 'we' (and also the impersonal 'one'); the children have formed their own community apart from the adult world."},

  Abstract                 = {"Photographs thus uncover what Walter Benjamin calls the 'optical unconscious' of reality (BGS II 371/BSW II 511 - 12)- those details which are not commonly visible to the naked eye and which can acquire a disquieting character, not least because of the element of chance which undermines the photographer's control over the resulting image." (3) "Kafka allegedly described himself as an 'Augenmensch' ['visual person', literally 'an eye man'] [...] Indeed, photography's particular fascination for him lay in its ability to open up previously unnoticed realms of reality, thus provoking reflection and interpretation." (3) "In Kafka's eyes, photographs offer only a limited and potentially puzzling view of reality, and he is frequently intrigued by what lies beyond the photographic frame." (4) - The author apparently provides an excellent introduction to the so-called state of the art in early XX century Prague. -> SHE DOES NOT. "Kafka's contemporaries were quick to realize the importance of photography for an understanding of his work. The 'photographic' nature of Kafka's texts was stressed by Sigfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and Theodor W. Adorno, who all discerned a deep affinity between his writings and the medium." (15) - Chapter 1 traces the Rezeptiongeschichte of Kafka in his relationship with photography - through Kracauer, Adorno, Benjamin. [Discussing Adorno's PoV] "Kafka's texts take the fragmenting effect of photography to a new extreme; having dissolved the familiar unity of reality, they resist the reintegration of its disparate elements itno a new harmonious whole. In Kracauer's reading, then, Kafka's works mobilize a photographic aesthetic of fragmentation, illustrating its disorienting consequences in scenarios which offer no scope for synthesis." - A discussion of a studio photograph of young Kafka; nobody seems to answer a crucial question: what is that child looking at? What is that distant gaze focusing on? - Chapter 2 is, of course, on cinema. "The spectacles of the city and the attractions of mass entertainment provide an inexhaustible source of inspiration for the young writer. Kafka's early diaries recount and illustrate his search for visual technologies which could be productively mobilized for the sake of literary creation. Indeed, encounters with photography, film, and stereoscopy not only yield ample thematic material, but also shape his literary style, as well as inspiring more general reflections about the relationship between vision and writing, literature and technology. Film harbours a particular fascination for Kafka less through particular motifs or storylines than because of its capacity to alter and expand human perception, offering a training ground for new modes of seeing. Yet Kafka's fascination with the vividness and dynamism of this new medium is not, as we shall see, entirely unequivocal. His attraction frequently gives way to an unsettling sense of exposure, and his fascination is intervowen with a latent anxiety: the fear of being conditioned and invaded by such spectacles as the girl in his dream." (36) "While Kafka's early diaries thus trace his undeniable fascination with the cinema, the ambiguity of these encounters in turn motivates the search for a visual paradigm more conducive to literary exploration. Indeed, it is through an incisive critique of film and its invasive, fragmenting effects that Kafka comes to embrace photography as a more productive and sustainable source of literary inspiration." (36) "For all their tangible vividness, the visual sketches and observations that appear throughout Kafka's early diaries are often the result of an intricate process of mediation. Indeed, even where media technologies are not explicitly thematized, they nonetheless provide a perceptual grid through which the encountered reality is experienced and recorded." (36) "Indeed, Kafka's variation of this anecdote captures more accurately the fascination of early film - the dichotomy between the fast-moving images projected onto the screen and the stillness of an audience which is passively, almost hypnotically, exposed to this spectacle." (37) - Beautiful ricompilation of Kafka confronting cinema in the Diaries. Yes, it is exactly as we had expected. "Kafka's account of a cinema visit in November 1913 betrays a deeply rooted ambivalence: Im Kino gewesen. Geweint. 'Lolotte'. Der gute Pfarrer [priest]. Das kleine Fahrrad. Die Versöhnung [reconciliation] der Eltern. Maßlose Unterhaltung. Vorher trauriger Film 'Das Unglück im Dock' nachher lustiger 'Endlich allein'. Bin ganz leer und sinnlos, die vorüberfahrende Elektrische [the passing tram] hat mehr lebendingen Sinn. (TB 595) The titles of the viewed films are juxtaposed with brief references to individual scenes as well as with equally matter-of-fact comments of the writer's own response - a fragmentary account which in turn mirrors the montage style of early film and its dissociating effect on the viewer. As Kafka's entry suggests, the experience of film defies assimilation into a coherent narrative." (38)},

  Abstract                 = {"Kafka wrote the gestic chase sequence during cinema's historical transition from theatrical perception to the systematisation of editing techniques and camera positions, which brought film language closer to the mobility of focal points found in nineteenth-century prose fiction. The split between slapstick routine and subjective reflection, and between consciousness and identity is emphasised by presenting the routine Karl is forced to inhabit as external to him, as though it were happening to someone else - a figure being pursued in an American chase comedy - but also through his introceptive focal point" (26) "The earliest films, such as the first chase films between 1901 and 1905, as Noël Burch argues, maintain the 'externality of the spectator', and historically precede the perceptual and physiological orientation of the spectator. This technique, cinema's mode of classical narration, emerged between 1907 and 1912 with the standardisation, primarily by D. W. Griffith, of the system of continuity editing, parallel cuts and the shot-reverse-shot, or the convention whereby the eyelines of characters are matched along an unseen 180-degree axis." (27) "Subjective focal points began to be written into cinema in films such as Griffith's _The Primal Call_ (1911), in which each of the two characters looks off-screen to the other, alternate cuts showing what each character sees, and Arthur Mackey's _The Loafer_ (1911), in which the camera again alternates viewpoints to encourage the spectator's identification with the character's point of view, which is also the view of the camera. Keystone comedies began to demonstrate a primitive spectator-subject identification in the use of reverse-angle cross-cutting from pursue to pursued [...]." (27)},

This time-zone has the most illustrious antecedents in mystical thought; it is the point of intersection between the immanent and transcendent worlds." (98)},

  Abstract                 = {Kafka's way of summarizing movies is strikingly synthetic: Sep. 23-24 1912 - "Cinematograph at the Landestheater. Box seat. Fräulein Oplatka, who was once pursued by a clergyman. She arrived home completely drenched in a cold sweat. Danzig. Körner's life. The horses. The white horse. The smoke from the gunpowder. Lützow's wild chase." (62) OBOY. This is a treasure of sources: "It is gestural translation that Theodor Adorno has in mind in a 1934 letter to Walter Benjamin when he writes (with a jab at Max Brod): "Thus Brod, with his banal reference to film, semms to me to have hit on something much more accurate than he could suspect. Kafka's novels are not prompt books for the experimental theater, for they are, in principle, lacking the audience that could take part in the experiment. Rather, they are the last, disappearing textual links to silent film (which, not coincidentally, disappeared almost simultaneously with Kafka's death)." [In truth, not that useful.]},
