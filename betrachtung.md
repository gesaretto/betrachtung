The observers go rigid as the train passes by. Die Zuschauer erstarren, wenn der Zug vorbeifährt. The first entrz in Kafka's diaries, like many to follow, is a meditation on vision, and on the effect that vision has on the observer. As it has been noticed, this short description can be easily superimposed with the mythical showing of one of the Lumière brothers' most popular shorts, Arrivée d'un train à la Ciotat, during which the audience notoriously fled from the theater (Duttlinger 37). Kafka's early writings, and his _Diaries_ in particular, constitute an endless sequence of small observations like this one, in which the peculiar relationships that are born between observer and observed are scrutinized and meditated upon. But what is precisely happening in this short, impressive scene? Why do the observers change their state - from what instability - or what ease - do they suddenly acquire that firm posture, do they change their stance by trying not to match the train's motion?
There is one obvious motivation, which is of course consistent with the episode of the projection at the theater where the Lumière were showing their short piece - fear. The spectators of the train passing, running, who are standing in front of it, on what we may assume is little more than a platform, feel fear - their acquired rigidity is a sort of overall step back from the dangerous motion of the train. This foreign, strange motion is the opposite from what they want from themselves - they desire to maintain their position, and therefore they retrocede. Another possibility is a sort of contemplative mode, that the train would suddenly activate - they want to enjoy the spectacle at the best of their capabilities, and therefore they stay rigid not to be distracted from it. There is, eventually, the unconscious engrossing phenomenon of being absorbed by something unknown. There is, finally, the fact that observation is a static activity, a static endeavor. Although the image is animated, the observer has to stand still in order to perceive that animation in full.
Let us think about this more thoroughly. Let us simply picture ourselves there; let us imagine that, instead of standing on the platform, observing the train as it leaves or approaches the station and going rigid, from some subconscious or conscious reason [by the way, another silly reason with which we might anticipate this reflection: the fact that the people observing the train are probably going to step onto it; they hold their luggage, they spy each wagon, each section of the train, peeking through the open windows, in search for an empty spot. It is a very practical endeavor, but it is sort of true; so, in the right order: 1) fear; 2) attention; 3) preliminary to motion; the attentive state that precedes the motion; I am still because I will have to move soon).] - and we were saying that, yes, if we were witnessing the scene ourselves, if we were on the platform and if there was a train moving, approaching or leaving the station, what would happen if, instead of being there and looking at it while standing, we were on board of another train, and if that train were moving at the same speed of the train moving? We would not be able to perceive that movement. The opposition between _repose_ and _motion_ is an opposition that is crucial to the observation of movement. "Erstarren" means to become rigid, and we might picture an overall movement of the body, something happening at the level of the back, of the shoulders, of the head - a sort of petrification; but that is not the only thing that might happen. We might have a simple stop from walking - the passengers were walking, they need to stop in order to see where to get onto the train. _Passenger_ is, nevertheless, the wrong word, the inappropriate word: the problem here is not with a passenger that needs to board a train; the problem, the concern, is observation - better still, spectatorship. These are _Zuschauer_, they are spectators - the automatism that the short sentence describes is the sort of automatism that concerns general problems of vision of a dynamic object - an object moves, and in order to see it moving, I need to stand still, to stay still.
If Kafka had been sitting in that Parisian theater where Ciotat was being shown, he would have probably been more concerned about his observation of the spectators than about the spectacle itself. Kafka would have been looking at the watchers, not at the show.

[This could be kept for the end.] There is, finally, the collocation of this same observation in a diaristic production: Kafka is observing the observers; Kafka is among the spectators of the moving train, but he does not move with them; instead, the exceptionality of this small observation lies precisely in the fact that, as the bystanders on a station platform, we would usually only be looking at the train, and not at the other bystanders; Kafka is the observer observing the observer. More: he registers this small observation in a note that we will read, and the movement of the train, contrasting with the stillness of the observers, will be also contrasting the stillness of our reading practice - on a couch, with an open book in our hands. And more - think about the small dynamic action of writing down this small thought in ink; think about the way in which this contrasts with the stillness of the printed word, and the stillness of the read word. <-__CRUCIAL.__ 

The observations that young Kafka collected in his diaries before 1912, which constitute almost half of his diaristic production as it has survived through the decades for us, have been interpreted as a reflection on the contrasting modes of _film_ and _photography_. Many of them are little experiments in prose, attempts at capturing glimpses of reality, and attempts at capturing glimpses of reality being observed. Critics have interpreted along the dichotomy between _motion_ and _repose_ (Ruhe and Unruhe), which Carolin Duttlinger has especially linked to the opposition between _photography_ (Ruhe) and _film_ (Unruhe), which Kafka would hav initially favored to the earlier. His experiments would have therefore led him to abandon the sort of dynamic acquisition of reality that is peculiar to cinema, in favor of a fragmentation of space in isolated, static images that we can easily relate to photography. Kafka would have abandoned the mode of a frantic registration of motion for a slow juxtaposition of still images.
This dichotomy resolved in a predilection for the latter - photography - is an interesting perspective on his early work. Kafka was certainly both a keen movie-goer and an attentive collector and observer of photographs; his early writings certainly possess a strong visual quality, and they seem peculiarly interested in problems of observation, motion, and stillness. This explorations later converged in his first published book _Betrachtung_, which served as a sort of compilation of his work up to the year 1912. _Betrachtung_ is a de-verbal noun derived from the verb _Betrachten, which means both _view_ and _consider_, a sort of lexical ambiguity that the English word _Observation_ might convey. It is singular in the original: it is a process and a disposition, an attitude that accompanies the writer and the reader through this series of short proses - which are not, by themselves, therefore, _observations_: they are instances of the infinite mode, of the indefinite mode, of _observation_; they could also be considered as _products_ of observation. In this small work, it has been argued, Kafka carefully exploits, explores and resolves his thoughts about the two contrasting media of _film_ and _photography_, finding a solution in the latter.
_Betrachtung_ is therefore a book in which the activity of the writer, and Kafka's diaristic activity, is associated with the mechanical means of reproduction of reality, namely photography and film; it is a book in which these two medias, both their process and their results, are transformed into a literary endeavor. It is therefore appropriate to ask __how__ did the writer manage to materialize this equation: how did the photographic and the filmic process of acquisition of reality translate itself - turn itself into - a literary means? We could add, or better - we could rephrase the question this way: what are the literary means that Kafka uses and analyzes in this small book, as embodiments of the mechanical devices of _film_ and _photography_? Would a specific analysis of this means reveal anything about his approach to these two forms, or would it instead open up the laboratory to wider questions about observation and identity?

[The conventional reading of _Betrachtung_: from the motion of the child on his swing, in the country street, to the repose of the man in bed, in his home in the city.]

The unit of measurement that film and photography have in common is, of course, the _frame_. A frame is a limited portion of reality, captured from a specific point of view, and at a specific time; it is a flattening of the tridimensional experience of space. It features limits that are more immediately explicit than the ones usually perceived by a human being.
Kafka enframes the perspective of his small narrative pieces in a multiplicity of manners in the small collection of _Betrachtung_: literal frames are pervasive. Mirrors are featured prominently in __The businessman__ (Der Kafumann), __Dresses__ (Kleider), and the final short story, __Unhappiness__ (Unglücklichsein); an open door is the frame from which the habits of __The businessman__ (Der Kaufmann) are peered at. Finally, the most pervasive form of literal enframing is certainly the window, from the two short stories that feature it as their central topic, in their title - __Wool-gathering at the window__ (Zerstreutes hinausschaun, literally - watching outside while absent minded) and __The window on the street__ (Das Gassenfenster) - to the uncomforting open window that closes the melancholic __The way home__ (Der Nachhausweg), to the one from which people spy on the young protagonist of __Children on the country street__ (Kinder auf der Landstraße), the first short story of the book. Besides the literal framing motif, this initial piece is in fact exemplary for the rest of the book, providing us with a definite idea of framing and shot.
After an initial aural sensation, the noise of the carts which are heard by the first-person narrator, the first thing that the reader is able to see are _occasional glimpses of them through the shifting gaps in the foliage_ (the German is slightly more explicit: "manchmal sah ich sie auch durch die schwach bewegten Lücken im Laub. (at times I even saw them through the slightly moving gaps in the leaves. This first definition already works as the infinitely small and ephemeral establishment of a _frame_; the peculiarity of this frame, however, is that it is moving, in the same exact way as the object that is being perceived is moving. And yet, we could either understand that the actual spectacle, the cars running on the street, is being partially concealed by a flexible screen, the leaves, or that the combination of the moving leaves, the small shifting gaps, and the flashing cars beyond them is what constitutes a general spectacle for the children; this is a fascinating problematization of our notions of frame and spectacle: we can easily picture the child contemplating the interaction between the leaves and the cars. The essence is that the fixed subject of the sentence, the stable and invisible __Ich__ with which the book opens, is static: the motion belongs to everything that comes after the verb __sah__: the cars are passing by him (vorbeifahren) and the gaps through which they can be perceived are incessantly moving (__bewegten__); the observer is apparently static, the observed is dynamic in front of him. A concept of framing, however problematic, still persists: the cars are seen only occasionally and through the leaves because the subjective, contingent point of view of the child is what needs to be emphasized. We soon discover that the child is sitting on a paradoxically static small swing (_kleinen Schaukel_): it is a further focus on his condition of repose; he could be swinging - is what a child on a swing usually does - but he instead stopped to look through the foliage, or better, to look at the moving foliage through which the cars could be seen. The first sequence of verbs relating to the child, and to the narrator of the collection itself, is an essential definition of the act of _betrachtung_: Ich hörte - sah ich - ich saß - ich ruhte mich. We have therefore discovered the child in a state of fixed observation: he is on his swing, he has the faculty to swing back and forth, to experience the childish frenzy of movement, and instead he hears and looks, sitting and resting in a reposed position. Ruhen is of course the verb absociated to Ruhen, the repose that Duttlinger would immediately associate to photography; and yet, this is the attitude of a movie-goer: we look at the repose of the movie-goer, sitting quietly while observing movement outside; this is not an explicit opposition between photography and film, this is an exploration of the act of observation that, at most, utilizes both the dynamism of cinema and the stasis of photography.
Then, after more contemplation, we suddenly have an inversion in this practice: the child is no longer static, and the swing moves. How? Because a flock of "birds flew up like spray".

> Dann flogen vögel wie sprühend auf, ich folgte ihnen mit den Blicken, sah, wie sie in einem Atemzug stiegen, bis nicht mehr glaubte, daß sie stiegen, sondern, daß ich falle, und fest mich an den Seilen haltend, aus Schwäche ein wenig zu schaukeln anfing. Bald schaukelte ich stärker, als die Luft schon kühler wehte und statt der fliegenden Vögel zitternde Sterne erschienen.

Panning was extremely rare in early cinema, although some directors were already placing their cameras on flying objects or running trams, in order to register the motion of a point of view together with the motion of the thing observed. Kafka is here slowly introducing us to the potential exhilaration of a moving point of view: the object that the child is trying to follow with his gaze is moving, so that his gaze has to move before that same object leaves the frame. We have no other option but picturing it as an actual enclosed frame: we are placed in the same position as the child, and we know that he won't be able to follow the flight of the flock without moving his eyes, or - probably - even his head. We understand his necessity of using his eyes, of _folgen mit den Blicken_, only if we understand that, if it had remained static, his point of view would have been insufficient. The expression "in einem Atemzug" is literally translated "with one breath", which creates some perplexity: does it mean "in one instant"? And what movement does it qualify, the flight of the birds or the gaze of the child? The German clearly associates it with the plural ascension of the birds - stiegen is a third person plural - but a flock of birds does not have breath, only a child does. Therefore, this motion is transferred from the observed object to the observer, and it instantiates a sort of mirroring movement in the observer and in the observed; the observer moves because the object that he was observing moved. This is different from everything that we have observed so far: it is different from the spectators watching the train and "going rigid", and it is different from what the child was doing at the beginning. By trying to condescend its object, the gaze of the observer reached a point when its object was outside of the frame defined by his point of view, and so it slowly moved to follow it. The flock of bids ascended, reached the limit of the observer's frame, and the gaze of the observer had to move to follow it. This adaptation anticipates a feature that we will examine later, that is the conformation of the observer to its object; and the projective push that an attempt to conform to a thought entails. However, this motion of following the flock reaches a paradox for which the observer has been absorbed by the motion belonging to the observed, which creates a peculiar inversion of perspective: the birds are fixed in the sky, and it is the subject that moves, not the object. This relates to our first hypothesis related to the motion of the train: what if we were sitting on a train while the train was moving, and what if the train on which we were was moving at the same speed as the train which we were looking at? We would not be able to perceive movement any longer. This brief paradox expresses precisely this concern: the birds are now static, and the subject is the one moving; one of the two has to stay fixed, the other has to move. This short paragraph stages precisely this transition: at the very beginning the observer is completely stable, looking at the double movement constituted by the shifting leaves creating mobile gaps against the fence through which running cars are perceivable; then he moves his sight when the birds ascend, so much that he gets the impression that they are fixed, while he is falling; he eventually starts swinging - becoming the mobile element of the equation - when the ascending birds are substituted by fixed, though flickering, stars.
