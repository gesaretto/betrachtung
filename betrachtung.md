The observers go rigid as the train passes by. Die Zuschauer erstarren, wenn der Zug vorbeifährt. The first entrz in Kafka's diaries, like many to follow, is a meditation on vision, and on the effect that vision has on the observer. As it has been noticed, this short description can be easily superimposed with the mythical showing of one of the Lumière brothers' most popular shorts, Arrivée d'un train à la Ciotat, during which the audience notoriously fled from the theater (Duttlinger 37). Kafka's early writings, and his _Diaries_ in particular, constitute an endless sequence of small observations like this one, in which the peculiar relationships that are born between observer and observed are scrutinized and meditated upon. But what is precisely happening in this short, impressive scene? Why do the observers change their state - from what instability - or what ease - do they suddenly acquire that firm posture, do they change their stance by trying not to match the train's motion?
There is one obvious motivation, which is of course consistent with the episode of the projection at the theater where the Lumière were showing their short piece - fear. The spectators of the train passing, running, who are standing in front of it, on what we may assume is little more than a platform, feel fear - their acquired rigidity is a sort of overall step back from the dangerous motion of the train. This foreign, strange motion is the opposite from what they want from themselves - they desire to maintain their position, and therefore they retrocede. Another possibility is a sort of contemplative mode, that the train would suddenly activate - they want to enjoy the spectacle at the best of their capabilities, and therefore they stay rigid not to be distracted from it. There is, eventually, the unconscious engrossing phenomenon of being absorbed by something unknown. There is, finally, the fact that observation is a static activity, a static endeavor. Although the image is animated, the observer has to stand still in order to perceive that animation in full.
Let us think about this more thoroughly. Let us simply picture ourselves there; let us imagine that, instead of standing on the platform, observing the train as it leaves or approaches the station and going rigid, from some subconscious or conscious reason [by the way, another silly reason with which we might anticipate this reflection: the fact that the people observing the train are probably going to step onto it; they hold their luggage, they spy each wagon, each section of the train, peeking through the open windows, in search for an empty spot. It is a very practical endeavor, but it is sort of true; so, in the right order: 1) fear; 2) attention; 3) preliminary to motion; the attentive state that precedes the motion; I am still because I will have to move soon).] - and we were saying that, yes, if we were witnessing the scene ourselves, if we were on the platform and if there was a train moving, approaching or leaving the station, what would happen if, instead of being there and looking at it while standing, we were on board of another train, and if that train were moving at the same speed of the train moving? We would not be able to perceive that movement. The opposition between _repose_ and _motion_ is an opposition that is crucial to the observation of movement. "Erstarren" means to become rigid, and we might picture an overall movement of the body, something happening at the level of the back, of the shoulders, of the head - a sort of petrification; but that is not the only thing that might happen. We might have a simple stop from walking - the passengers were walking, they need to stop in order to see where to get onto the train. _Passenger_ is, nevertheless, the wrong word, the inappropriate word: the problem here is not with a passenger that needs to board a train; the problem, the concern, is observation - better still, spectatorship. These are _Zuschauer_, they are spectators - the automatism that the short sentence describes is the sort of automatism that concerns general problems of vision of a dynamic object - an object moves, and in order to see it moving, I need to stand still, to stay still.

[This could be kept for the end.] There is, finally, the collocation of this same observation in a diaristic production: Kafka is observing the observers; Kafka is among the spectators of the moving train, but he does not move with them; instead, the exceptionality of this small observation lies precisely in the fact that, as the bystanders on a station platform, we would usually only be looking at the train, and not at the other bystanders; Kafka is the observer observing the observer. More: he registers this small observation in a note that we will read, and the movement of the train, contrasting with the stillness of the observers, will be also contrasting the stillness of our reading practice - on a couch, with an open book in our hands. And more - think about the small dynamic action of writing down this small thought in ink; think about the way in which this contrasts with the stillness of the printed word, and the stillness of the read word. <-__CRUCIAL.__ 

The observations that young Kafka collected in his diaries before 1912, which constitute almost half of his diaristic production as it has survived through the decades for us, have been interpreted as a reflection on the contrasting modes of _film_ and _photography_. Many of them are little experiments in prose, attempts at capturing glimpses of reality, and attempts at capturing glimpses of
