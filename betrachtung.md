#"Doch sehe ich, da ich nahe stehe": Filmic devices and literary subjectivity in Kafka's _Betrachtung_

_Die Zuschauer erstarren, wenn der Zug vorbeifährt._ The bystanders go rigid as the train passes by. The first entry in Kafka's diaries, like many to follow (Duttlinger 2007, 36), is a meditation on vision, and on the effect that vision has on the observer: inevitably, as if they were joined to the tyrannical gears of an invisible machine, the beholders of the passing train react to its motion by acquiring a stiff posture. Unlike some of the characters that we will meet later, these subjects are neither passengers (_Fahrgäste_) nor passers-by (_Vorüberlaufenden_): they are spectators (_Zuschauer_), whose only prerogative and function, within the boundaries of the brief annotation, is that of watching (_schauen_) the engine run in front of them.

As it has been noticed, this gnomic annotation easily reminds us of the mythical - and probably apocryphal - incident that accompanied the supposed first showing of one of the Lumière brothers' most popular shorts, _L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat_: as the filmed train threateningly approached the audience, from the other side of the screen, the spectators stood up and fled from the theater. Kafka's entry, therefore, would be inverting the notion at the basis of the notorious anecdote: the spectators do not run away - the spectators stay still.

A complete conflation of the two occurrences might, however, become misleading. Despite having been frequently quoted, the first entry of the _Diaries_ still deserves further consideration: the beholders in Kafka's train station and those attending the Lumières' show occupy different positions, and are apparently motivated by opposite intentions. In fact, we know very well why the spectators watching _La Ciotat_ would have fled, at least according to the legend: they were afraid of the vehicle rushing towards them. But what about the reason for which Kafka's _Zuschauer_ "go rigid"?
 
Fear could again be an obvious motivation, and one that would be paradoxically consistent with its filmic analog. The spectators on the platform, whom Kafka is supposedly describing, would very unlikely be placed right in front of the advancing engine, like the camera used by the Lumières: they would instead be watching the arrival from a side perspective. A slight sensation of fear for the fast mechanism, still rather unfamiliar at the time, would paralyze them in an attempt not to be swept away by its course: stasis is a spontaneous reaction to the anxiety of uncontrollable motion. Other explanations might be even more trivial: they are scanning the cars to look for their seat, or they are expecting a familiar face; they are simply holding to their luggage while preparing for the hasty activity of boarding the train.

We might, however, formulate a more profound and more pervasive interpretation for this  simple sentence, one that would link the automatism that it describes to the automatism that is inherent in any static observation of a dynamic object. A sort of contemplative mode is suddenly activated by the arrival of the train: the casual passengers, or bystanders, become watchers as the vehicle approaches the station. They can perceive the motion of the train, in its full faculties of energy and speed, because they are standing still on the immovable space of the platform; if they were, for instance, sitting on a second train, moving at the same velocity of the first train, its motion would be imperceptible. Their _erstarren_, the petrified _repose_ (_Ruhe_) produced by the only action that Kafka records about them, "going rigid", is the necessary condition to their _zuschauen_, to the watching of _motion_ (_Unruhe_). In this way, they eventually resemble more fully the actual - and not legendary - audience of _La Ciotat_: a still congregation of viewers, captivated by the projection of movement.

As we have mentioned, many of the annotations that the young Kafka collected in his journals before 1912, and which constitute almost half of his extant diaristic production, are comparable experiments in prose, similarly attempting to capture ephemeral and often inconspicuous glimpses of reality, with a special emphasis on the processes of the visible. Like this first entry, they have often been interpreted as a reflection on the contrasting modes of _photography_ and _cinema_, a dichotomy contiguous with the opposition between _repose_ and _motion_ (_Ruhe_, or _photography_, and _Unruhe_, or _cinema_). According to Carolin Duttlinger (2007), for instance, this experimentation would have led Kafka to abandon an initial filmic impressionism, through which he tried to reproduce the endless dynamism of perception, in favor of a fragmentation of space into juxtaposed static images, which we could identify as photographic. Biographical evidence and literary production support this analysis: Kafka was certainly both a keen movie-goer and an attentive collector of photographs (Zischler); his early publications undoubtedly possess a strong visual quality, while being peculiarly interested in problems of spectatorship and movement. 

These investigations converged in his first published book, _Betrachtung_, a collection of eighteen short stories which served as a sort of personal anthology of his work up to the year 1912. The title, _Betrachtung_, is a deverbal noun derived from _betrachten_, a word which means both _to view_ and _to consider_: this deliberate ambiguity might be translated into English expressions such as _contemplation_ or, perhaps more explicitly, _observation_. It is a singular form, indicating both an overall disposition and an ongoing process: each small prose - the longest occupies four pages, the shortest three sentences - does not constitute, in itself, a single _observation_; they are, rather, both the occurrences and the products of an infinite and indefinite attitude of _observation_.

Suspended between the ongoing temporality of its title and the instantaneous duration of its constitutive elements, _Betrachtung_ is a book which intimates a correspondence between the activity of the writer and the mechanical reproduction of gaze, achieved through a literary emulation of devices drawn from photography and film (Huyssen 215). The main purpose of this paper is, therefore, to investigate and to interpret the actual ways in which Kafka managed to translate filmic and photographic modes of acquisition into formal aspects of his prose.

The constitutive unit that film and photography have in common is, of course, the _frame_ (or _shot_). A frame flattens the tridimensional experience of space, capturing a finite portion of reality from a specific point of view. In contrast to the automated reproduction that characterizes photographic media, the boundaries of a frame are intentionally established by a human subject, and they determine its uniqueness by delimiting the scope of the picture, while excluding everything else (Benjamin). Whenever the narrator of _Betrachtung_ explicitly adopts a restricted visual perspective, with varying degrees of stylistic emphasis, we may assume that Kafka's intention is that of evoking the literal edges of a frame.

From a basic standpoint, actual frames are pervasive in the small collection of _Betrachtung_. Mirrors, for instance, are featured in __The businessman__ (_Der Kafumann_), __Dresses__ (_Kleider_), and in the final short story, __Unhappiness__ (_Unglücklichsein_); an open door is, on the other hand, the recognizable frame from which spy on __The bachelor's lot__ (_Das Unglück des Junggsellen_). The most frequent manifestation of architectural framing in the book is nevertheless constituted by the ubiquity of the window: from the two short stories that feature it as their central topic, __Wool-gathering at the window__ (_Zerstreutes hinausschaun_, literally "watching outside while absent minded") and __The window on the street__ (_Das Gassenfenster_), to the uncomforting glance that, again from an open window, closes the melancholic __The way home__ (_Der Nachhausweg_). These physical structures represent, however, only a marginal, though blatant, aspect of Kafka's experimentation on the _frame_: __Children on the country street__ (_Kinder auf der Landstraße_), the first short story of the collection, emblematically integrates this motif, a window through which passers-by bother the young protagonist, with a complex series of more stylistically elaborate shots. We will often return to this initial piece, whose opening is, in itself, an ideal model for the _frame_.

> Ich hörte die Wagen an dem Gartengitter vorüberfahren, manchmal sah ich sie auch durch die schwach bewegten Lücken im Laub. [...]
> Ich saß auf unserer kleinen Schaukel, ich ruhte mich gerade aus zwischen den Bäumen im Garten meiner Eltern.

After having heard the noise of the carts, the narrator is barely able to discern them "through the slightly moving gaps in the leaves". This first arrangement of flexible apertures might already be understood as the infinitely small and ephemeral establishment of a _frame_, whose visual boundaries simultaneously limit the protagonist and the reader's perception. The peculiarity of this _frame_, however, is that it is in itself moving, in the same way as the carts beyond it. We could, in fact, consider the whole combination of the rustling leaves, the minute shifting gaps, and the moving carts beyond them as the authentic spectacle observed by the child: anything that follows the verb __sah__ is indistinctly part of the show. What frames the spectacle, therefore, is the contrast between the static and invisible __Ich__, the fixed subject of the sentence with which the book opens, and the mobility of what is being observed (the carts _vorüberfahren_, the leaves _swach bewegten_). The repose of the watcher is in fact further emphasized as we discover that he is sitting on a small swing (_kleinen Schaukel_), which however remains paradoxically inanimate. The child could be swinging back and forth, as we would expect him to do; rather, the series of verbs that introduces the first narrator of the collection is a basic definition of the act of _betrachtung_: "Ich hörte", "sah ich", "ich saß", and "ich ruhte mich". We have found him in a state of fixed _observation_: _ruhen_ (_to rest_) is of course the verb absociated _Ruhe_, the repose that Duttlinger would associate to photography; this is, nevertheless, the condition of a film spectator, sitting still while watching an animate screen. Motion and repose always oppose the subject who observes and the object being observed: they are both part of _Betrachtung_, but they are alternately attributed to either the watcher or the spectacle.

An example of this reciprocity of this alternation is, in fact, the circumstance that immediately follows this first observation. As a flock of birds crosses the sky, the child and the swing start moving, appropriating the quality of motion.

> Dann flogen vögel wie sprühend auf, ich folgte ihnen mit den Blicken, sah, wie sie in einem Atemzug stiegen, bis nicht mehr glaubte, daß sie stiegen, sondern, daß ich falle, und fest mich an den Seilen haltend, aus Schwäche ein wenig zu schaukeln anfing. Bald schaukelte ich stärker, als die Luft schon kühler wehte und statt der fliegenden Vögel zitternde Sterne erschienen.

The filmic device that today we call "panning", a moving shot along a vertical or horizontal axis, was extremely rare in early cinema, but it was not entirely absent: in the 1900s and 1910s some directors were already placing their cameras on flying objects or running trams, in order to record the exhilarating point of view of an active vehicle. After having presented the qualities of a fixed _observation_, Kafka is here slowly introducing us to a similar animation, associated to the establishment of a mobile _frame_: the flock that the child is trying to follow with his sight (_folgen mit den Blicken_) is moving towards the edges that determine his subjective _frame_, so that his gaze has to shift upwards. As this change occurs, however, the narrator registers a decisive inversion, marked by the exclusive conjunction _sondern_: as the observer's activity increases, the observed object is progressively more fixed, until the point when (_bis nicht mehr_) the motion belongs solely to the watcher, and it is 
paradoxically upturned (_ich falle_ instead of _sie stiegen_). The substitution is complete when the narrator starts swinging more intensely (_schaukelte ich stärker_), and the ascending birds are replaced by fixed stars: in a second cinematic inversion, where the subject has replaced the position of the camera, repose (_Ruhe_) is a quality entirely belonging to the object, whereas motion (_Unruhe_) belongs to the movable subject.

In the first pages of _L'Éducation Sentimentale_, Kafka's most admired novel (Rolleston 85), Flaubert similarly transfers the experience of motion from the perception of the observer to the properties of the object being observed: as the protagonist of the book, Frédéric, leaves the surroundings of Paris on a ferry boat, the third person singular of the narrator describes how, on the visible shores, "[*o*]n rencontrait des trains de bois qui se mettaient à onduler sous le remous des vagues" (48). The progress of the vessel is virtually unnoticed by the moving watcher, who instead sees the woody coast running and undulating in front of him: the writer absorbs this individual sensation into his seemingly omniscient voice, constructing an impressionistic world where subjectivities and objectivity blend seamlessly. Although he is drawing from this visual quality of realistic fiction, Kafka's interest in the actual dynamics of a moving perspective is both more subtle and more problematic. This attention to the paradoxical features of vision is one aspect of the _framing_ that this series of short narratives consistently explores; as we have seen, the essential concern for Kafka is to show how the observation of a mobile object usually produces an immobile observer, and vice versa. In the small encounter described in __Passers-by__ (_Die Vorüberlaufenden__), for instance, the accidental spotting of a mysterious man running towards the narrator provokes a stasis that is framed with an explicit pictorial quality:

> Wenn man in einer Nacht durch eine Gasse spaziergeht, und ein Mann, von weitem schon sichtbar - denn die Gasse vor uns steigt an und es ist Vollmond -, uns entgegenläuft, so werden wir ihn anpacken, selbst wenn er schwach und zerlumpt ist, selbst wenn jemand hinter ihm läuft und schreit, sondern wir werden ihn weiterlaufen lassen.

The principle that contrasts repose with motion acquires here a literal denotation: the full moon and the sloping street form an actual _frame_ above and below a running man, visible (_sichtbar_) by the impersonal character (_man_) from afar; to this perceived movement, the observer automatically reacts with a halt, like the bystanders watching the train.

Besides this pivotal dichotomy, however, framing can assume more photographic qualities in _Betrachtung_. At times it becomes, for instance, the fragmentary observation of an entirely static object, which is further entirely isolated from its context: it is the case of the descriptive short prose dedicated to __Dresses__ (_Kleider_), where a relative clause separates the observed clothes from the women wearing them.

> Oft wenn ich Kleider mit vielfachen Falten, Rüschen und Behängen sehe, die über schönen Körper schön sich legen, dann denke ich, daß sie nicht lange so erhalten bleiben, sondern Falten bekommen [...].

By means of a syntactical inversion, allowed by the initial adverb _Oft_, the _Kleider_ which compose the object of vision, and therefore the direct object of the verbal construction depending on the first person singular _ich_ [...] _sehe_, are enclosed within a large clause, which incorporates their characteristic richness: vielfachen _Falten_, _Rüschen_, _Behängen_; the wearers of the dresses, _schönen Körper_, are instead relegated to a subordinate phrase. The three elements of the garments evidently fragment our observation into three distinct frames: _Falten_, or _creases_, usually enrich the wider portions of a dress, such as a skirt; _Rüschen_, or _ruffles_ are usually positioned around the waist or the neck; the _Behängen_ hang instead from the sleeves or of from the lower fringes. After clothing itself, the details of clothing are therefore isolated again in a juxtaposition of close-ups. This progressive fragmentation of gaze is then mirrored by a second destructured vision, this time concerning the wearers.

> Doch sehe ich Mädchen, die wohl schön und vielfach reizende Muskeln und Knöchelchen und gespannte Haut und Massen dünner Haare zeigen [...]

On one side we have the _Kleider_, on the other the _Mädchen_: the clothes and their wearers have been separated by parallel syntactic choices, and then subdivided into their constitutive elements. These are conventional literary means, correspinding to an ekphrasis in the first instance, and to a sort of lyrical _blason_ in the second one; the explicit visual isolation of each detail ("sehe [...] ich", "Doch sehe ich"), nevertheless, is what produces the impression of a sequence of stills. Language is used as a zooming device, or as a powerful chiaroscuro: respecting the prerogative of the _frame_, it illuminates a detail while excluding another one.

The elements that contribute to the idea of _framing_ in the short collection are therefore an explicit attention to its limits, a contrast between _repose_ and _motion_, and an isolation and fragmentation of details. A representative combination of these features is presented in __The passenger__ (_Der Fahrgast_). This whole short story is in fact an experiment of _repose_ in _motion_: like the child on the swing, the narrator is paradoxically able to convey a sense of stillness while occupying an emphatically dynamic setting. 

> Ich stehe auf der Plattform des elektrischen Wagens und bin vollständig unsicher in Rücksicht meiner Stellung in dieser Welt, in dieser Stadt, in meiner Familie. [...] Ich kann es gar nicht verteidigen, daß ich auf dieser Plattform stehe, mich an dieser Schlinge halte, von diesem Wagen mich tragen lasse, daß Leute dem Wagen ausweichen oder still gehn oder vor den Schaufenstern ruhn.

The character's instability is twofold: on the one hand, he is physically on board of a tramway car; on the other hand, his existential posture is explicitly unsteady. Nevertheless, the stylistic choices used for this segment contradict its literal meaning: there is a paradoxical inconsistency between the transiency of the subject's placement and conscience, and the fixedness of his point of view as a narrator. Everything is indeed moving, except for him: after the concentrical climax of his first localization, from "dieser Welt", to "dieser Stadt", to "meiner Familie", a parallel concatenation of spatial prepositions and adverbs - "auf dieser Platform, an dieser Schlinge, von diesem Wagen" - reiterates his standpoint at the center of an unmistakeable specificity, marked by a parallel succession of deictics. Through the focus on his point of view, the passenger has become the invisible axis around which the entire world is spinning, and the supposed objectivity of his description has become a product of his subjectivity.

The same trajectory from an objective to a subjective perception is conveyed by the description of the lady who subsequently enters the car.

> Sie ist schwarz gekleidet, die Rockfalten bewegen sich fast nicht, die Bluse ist knapp und hat einen Kragen aus weißer kleinmaschiger Spitze, die linke Hand hält sie flach and die Wand, der Schirm in ihrer Rechten steht auf der zweiteriobersten Stufe. Ihr Gesicht ist braun, die Nase, an der Seiten schwach gepreßt, schließt rund und breit ab. Sie hat viel braunes Haar und verwehte Härchen an der rechten Schläfe. Ihr kleines Ohr liegt eng an, doch sehe ich, da ich nahe stehe, den ganzen Rücken der rechten Ohrmuschel und den Schatten an der Wurzel.

The passage offers a carefully designed motion towards the intimacy of both the observer and the observed object, through a series of minutely designed frames that create the impression of a slow adherence of the narrator's gaze to the body of its recipient. It opens with a frame, or a syntactic clause, containing her full figure, like a sort of dark silhouette: we can only see the _schwarz_ color of her clothes. The protagonist's eye then follows a bottom-to-top progression, from the lower end of the skirt, its _Rockfalten_, to the blouse (_die Bluse_) and the top of the collar (_Spitze_). The sequence creates a sort of temporal stasis, as if through this insistent look, erotically charged in its explicitly vertical discovery of her body, the _Mädchen_ had left the contingent deixis of the scene to be inspected within a sort of transcendent space, omnisciently displayed in the third person singular; she becomes besides, like the main character, surprisingly still: her clothes do not move at all - "bewegen sich fast nicht" - and every detail conveys a perception of fixedness and fastness, including the _knapp_ ("close") shirt and the collar. The woman has entered the dimension of _repose_ that seemed exclusive to the narrator; she seems thus to be observable from every angle, so that the imaginary camera capturing her presence, whose moves are uniform with the breaks and connections of syntax, initially embraces her in a supposed full circle. We move from her left hand, adhering carefully to the wall, to the umbrella in her right hand, which we follow to the second step supporting its weight, contributing to a sense of stability. Although the two clauses juxtapose their position, however, the two hands do not have the same grammatical function: only the left hand is a grammatical subject, whereas the subject of the second sentence is the _Schirm_ that leans on the step. This disparity seems to suggest a first visual limitation, as if the narrator were able to see her left hand better than her right hand, from a sort of slightly tilted side perspective. The second sentence does not contradict this bounded view: although the narrator is capable of looking at her _Gesicht_, he only focuses on her complexion, giving no detail about her traits other than the shape of her _Nase_. The depiction of her hair is by contrast more specific, and it stresses only one side of her head, the right _Schläfe_. We slowly understand that the narrator is watching her from a specific position, which favors her left hand, her right temple, and the back of her head. The last detail constitutes the apex of this progressive focus: the parallel hands that were unequally described in the previous sentence are here matched by an asymmetrical look on a small ear, existing singularly within the observer's limited _frame_. As it magnifies the most infinitely minute detail, the small shadow at the root of her earshell, the writing insists on its subjective origin: _doch sehe ich, da ich nach stehe_. From the general visibility of her outline, absorbed in the third person singular of an omniscient narrator, the narrative shifted to the _frame_ of an unquestionably individual point of view.

Besides _framing_, a second cinematic device that these early experiments seem to imitate is _editing_. This device, "the most widely discussed film technique" , was undergoing an intense process of transformation in this epoch, which established the essential grammar of filmic presentation: between the beginning of the century and the 1910s, the medium started to define the ways in which joining different shots together could contribute to the illusion of narrative, poetic, temporal, and spatial progression. Film critic and historian David Bordwell counts four functions for editing: it can be used to institute "[*g*]raphic relations between shot A and shot B; rythmic relations between shot A and shot B; spatial relations between shot A and shot B, temporal relations between shot A and shot B" (218-227). Cinema inherited these techinques from literature: the graphic similarities presented by two shots, such as the recurrent presence of round objects at the center of the screen, for instance, are analogous to prosodic and metrical tropes such as anaphora, alliteration, or rhyme. Kafka unsurprisingly employs again these figures of repetition, especially evident in the syntactical arrangement of these short stories: as we have seen, in both __Kleider__ and __Der Fahrgast__, for example, an idea of isomorphism and rythm was conveyed by the structures used to juxtapose the different angles of the descriptions.

Like _editing_ in cinema, syntax is therefore used to join the occasionally static stills of _Betrachtung_ in different ways: the connections can create parallelisms or contrasts, or the impressions of repose and motion. A clear example of rythmic acceleration achieved by syntactical choices is the story entitled __The spur-of-the-moment stroll__ (_Der Plötzliche Spaziergange_). The short prose describes the moment when an anonymous man takes the dramatically sudden decision, against the forces of drowsiness, habit, and inclement weather, to leave his room and his house to enjoy a walk in the open air. The decision is incapsulated within an elaborate single sentence, introduced by a number of subordinate clauses starting with the subjunctive preposition _wenn_: four before the decision to walk out, and four after it.

> Wenn man sich am Abend endgültig entschlossen zu haben scheint, zu Hause zu bleiben, den Hausrock angezogen hat, nach dem Nachtmahl beim beleuchtetem Tisch sitzt und jene Arbait oder jenes Spiel vorgenommen hat, nach dessen Beendigung man gewohnheitsgemäß schlafen geht, wenn draußen ein unfreundliches Wetter ist, welches das Zuhausebleiben selbverständlich macht, wenn man jetzt auch schon so lange bei Tisch stillgehalten hat, daß Weggehen allgemeines Erstaunen hervorrufen müßte, wenn nun auch schon das Treppenhaus dunkel und das Haustor gesperrt ist, und wenn man nun trozt alledem in einem plötzlichen Unbehagen aufsteht [...]

Each _wenn_ displays a different frame: the first one locates the impersonal subject (_man_) at his table, at evening and after dinner; the second peeks at the unfavorable weather outside; the third one inspects the monotonous company inside; the fourth one pictures the dark staircase and the closed door that separate the protagonist from his goal. Each frame is progressively less elaborate, and therefore progressively shorter: the time devoted to each picture diminishes as the decision to walk out becomes clearer. The first conditional clause contains a total of four subordinate verbs; the second and the third incorporate one clause each; the fourth one comprises only one third person verb, _ist_. A sense of escalating liberation is conveyed by the sequence, whose anaphoric buildup not only creates a definite spatial and temporal transition, but defines a specific rythimcal pattern.

Syntactical density often conveys this sense of velocity: together with the visual aspect of the _frames_, this stylistical choice occasionally challenges the literal content of a narrative, creating unexpected impressions of movement or stasis. __The way home__ (_Der Nachhausweg_), for instance, experiments with the coexistence of framing and editing in the definition of a subjective rythm that might contrast with the rythm of a supposedly objective reality. In the short story, an urban flâneur is picturing the changing context that surrounds him.

> Ich marschiere und mein Tempo ist das Tempo dieser Gassenseite, dieser Gasse, dieses Viertels. Ich bin mit Recht verantwortlich für alle Schläge gegen Türen, auf die Platten der Tische, für alle Trinksprüche, für die Liebespaare in ihren Betten, in den Gerüsten der Nebauten, in dunklen Gassen an die Häusermauer gepreßt, auf den Ottomanen der Bordelle.

Motion here belongs to the observer and not to the observed object. Like in the first instances that we have analyzed, the emulation of film implies this dichotomy: either the camera is moving or the subject is moving. The _Tempo_ that the observer is able to project against the objects perceived during his march is not the _Tempo_ of their actual activity, but the _Tempo_ of their rapid visual succession, produced by his own movement. There is no verb in these phrases: all of the objects that the observer mentions are perfectly still, and therefore purely nominal; their motion is only existent in the succession allowed by syntactic structuring, punctuation, and juxtaposition. They are fixed _frames_, stitched by a tripartite alternation of adjectives and prepositions: first three deictic adjectives, then three prepositions introduced by _für_, finally three spatial complements introduced by _in_ and _auf_.

The hypothetical mode, introduced by the conjunction "wenn", is a recurrent syntactic device in _Betrachtung_. A similar example, already investigated by Duttlinger (2013, 24), is the hastening cinematic prose of __Wanting to be a Red Indian__ (_Wunsch, Indianer zu werden_): the piece presents again a rythmic acceleration conveyed by a sequence of pictorial frames, segmented by parallel syntactical choices. Like __Spur-of-the-moment stroll__, it opens with a "wenn", which is then amplified by a series of short clauses: these suspend and postpone the fulfillment of the condition, therefore participating to the sensation of suspense and acceleration. In order to investigate the importance of the hypothetical mode in the filmic remediation of Kafka's prose, we will now focus on a final device drawn from cinema: the _point of view_ shot (Bordwell 233).

The _frame_ is, as we have seen, the basic visual unit of _Betrachtung_: it is the description of an object which presupposes a disparity between a static observer and a dynamic spectacle, or vice versa; it explicitly affirms its own optical boundaries; it combines together different planes of perception, in a sort of stereoscopic flattening that occasionally produces a sensation of estrangement (Crary 89). As in a sort of literary _editing_, _frames_ are connected by syntactic devices that emphasize attributes of graphic analogy, spatial and temporal difformity, and rythm. We feel, however, that the major cinematic intuition of Kafka's collection pertains to the specific attributes that the grammar of film attributes to the _point of view_ shot. Becoming widespread in the early 1910s (Paraskeva 27), the use of this filmic device presupposes that, in order to create a sense of identification with the actors of a narrative, the director and the editor should alternate _frames_ of the objects observed by the characters with _frames_ that register their reactions; based on a concatenation of _reverse shots_, this foundational device ought to produce systematic emotional reactions in the spectator.

Kafka demonstrates a firm awareness of the potentialities implicit in this means in the opening short story,  _Kinder auf der Landstrasse_, which we have already begun to examine. As we have seen, the narrative starts with a subjective frame, depicting the spectacle observed by a child that is either resting or swinging. At this point of the story we have only a minor intuition about this character's identity: we have appropriated his perspective, but we have been unable to picture him yet. The following paragraph tries to satisfy our curiosity.

> Bei Kerzenlicht bekam ich mein Nachtmahl. Oft hatte ich beide Arme auf der Holzplatte und, schon müde, biß ich in mein Butterbrot. Die stark durchbrochenen Vorhänge bauschten sich im warmen Wind, und manchmal hielt sie einer, der draußen vorüberging, mit seinen Händen fest, wenn er mich besser sehen und mit mir reden wollte. Meistens verlöschte die Kerze bald und in dem dunklen Kerzenrauch trieben sich noch eine Zeitlan die versammelten Mücken herum. Fragte mich einer vom Fenster aus, so sah ich ign an, als schaue ich ins Gebirge oder in die bloße Luft, und auch ihm war an einer Antwort nicht viel gelegen.

Like the intrusive observer at the window, who strives to "besser sehen" the drowsy child, the reader wishes to spy on the young narrator of the story. The billowing curtains of this temporary vision resemble the moving foliage of the opening; but instead of watching what the watcher was watching, this time we are watching the watcher himself. This stolen close-up - only the upper half of the small boy is visible - functions as the _reverse point of view shot_ matching the initial subjective _frame_. Similarly, the exchange between the intruder and the child is entirely conveyed through their mutual observation. After an initial resistance, the visitor is eventually able to penetrate the architectural frame of the window (_Sprang dann einer über die Fensterbrüstung_), and we eventually understand that this observer is in fact a second child. The _reverse shot_ has produced an identification that is now mirrored by a stylistical change: from the first person singular of the beginning we switch to a first person plural. The core of the narrative will eventually transform this collective perspective into a general one: the _wir_ that had included the reader as a child becomes an impersonal _man_, as if the subjective sight of the opening had become entirely objective. The purpose of the entire short story seems in fact to be an attempt to recover a lost gaze, the gaze of a child, through the act of _Betrachtung_: the _point of view_ shot is the means to achieve this empathic restoration.

Gaze therefore functions as a mode of transference in the collection; it is the way in which the narrator produces modes of identification between the reader and the characters that inhabit his literary world. In many of the narratives that we have analyzed so far, the _point of view shot_, matched by a _reverse shot_ registering the reaction of the narrator, institutes modes of identification that are peculiar to each circumstance, accompanied by either static isolation, syntactic density, or the _motion_ and _repose_ dychotomy. The hypothetical mode of __Spur-of-the-moment stroll__, __Wanting to be a Red Indian__, __The excursion into the mountains__ (_Der Ausflug ins Gebirge_), and many other moments of _Betrachtung_, constitutes in fact a convergence of these visual tropes into a synthesis that can be solely literary: like the readers of the collection, these characters are found in a condition of _repose_ that coincides with the observation of an inner _motion_. By watching them, and by watching the recorded projections of their thoughts, written language allows a penetration and a transcendent disclosure of the self (Sokel), which prompts a push of imagination (Spivak 7) beyond the discrete individualities of the visible. Kafka observes the observers, as the train passes by: the motion of his writing unites their repose to that of the reader.
