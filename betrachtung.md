# Notes on Betrachtung

## A list of facts and ideas

1. Betrachtung is a series of 18 short stories written between 1904 and 1912 and published in 1912.
1. Betrachtung means "vision" and, of course, "contemplation"; it is the space between observing and thinking.
1. Here are some observations about each of the short stories:
1. __Children in the lane__ (Kinder auf der Landstraße):
 > Transference from narrator to subject through sight and perspective; I become you since you I am seeing what you are seeing.
 1. __Unmasking a confidence trickster__ (Entlarvung eines Bauernfängers)
 > The imagined interiors; static street, dynamic interiors; the revealing smile - a detail that only psychoanalysis or cinema could spot, at least according to Benjamin (cinema taught us how to break a human countenance into its constitutive parts).
 1. __The spur-of-the-moment stroll__ (Der Plötzliche Spaziergange)
 > Motion becomes syntax; motion is visual and it becomes syntactic. A sequence of "wenn" subordinates, interrupted by a syntactical variation - "und wenn" - and followed by a symmetrical sequence of "wenn" subordinates; they are again interrupted by "-- dann ist". Syntax is the device which, like vision, allows for motion.
 1. __Decisions__ (Entschlüsse)
 > A short vision of social motion and arrest. Again, attention to the micro-gesture (Benjamin). No more to add at this point.
 1. __The excursion into the mountains__ (Der Ausflug ins Gebirge)
 > This short direct speech ---
 1. __The businessman__ (Der Kaufmann)
 > Well-known mode in Kafka: a monologue about a character who unveils the strangeness of his habits. Very interesting passage on the first page (26) "...all I can do is go home, because my face and hands are soiled and sweaty, my clothes are stained and dusty, I am wearing my working cap, and my boots bear the scratches of packing-case nails. At such times, I walk as if wave-borne, clicking the fingers of both hands and, as children pass, stroking their hair." How can this constitute a first-person perspective? We can see him walking - the detail of his fingers clicking; and then we become him and his hands - we see his hands as if they were ours - as he caresses the child's hair. This is a short story about subjectivity - about seeing oneself: (27) "...I prop myself on my knees to look in the narrow mirror. As the lift begins its ascent I say: Be still all of you, step back, if you will, into the shade of the trees [...] I speak with my teeth." The existence of the mirror - the problem of the mirror - the gaze into the mirror. These spaces, this microscopical spaces of the self, become the immensity 
 1. __Wool-gathering at the window__ (INSERT GERMAN)
 > A mysterious thing. The attempt to capture an instant is evident - an instant of transition between two irretrievable moments, before and after. **This morning** the sky was *grey*; **now** one is surprised and leans one's cheek against the window catch. The *light of the sun* against a child-like girl. There is, of course, an inversion: we had *shadow* **before**, we have *sunlight* **now**; but the face of the child is *bright* **now** and will be **shadowed** soon - it is being shadowed now by the "man coming up behind her". **Then** the man has gone past, and the child's face is ***really** bright*. We cannot see an important moment - we cannot see the shadow.

 1. __The trees__ (Die Bäume)
 1. __Unhappiness__ (Unglücklichsein)
 > Short apparition of a child ghost. Dialogue. Something could be said about how dialogue is antithetical to motion and sight; dialogue as the paralisis of motion and sight - as the embodiment of stasis itself.
