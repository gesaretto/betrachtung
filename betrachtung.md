# Notes on Betrachtung

## A list of facts and ideas

1. Betrachtung is a series of 18 short stories written between 1904 and 1912 and published in 1912.
1. Betrachtung means "vision" and, of course, "contemplation"; it is the space between observing and thinking.
1. Here are some observations about each of the short stories:
11. Children in the lane (Kinder auf der Landstraße):
	> Transference from narrator to subject through sight and perspective; I become you since you I am seeing what you are seeing.
11. Unmasking a confidence trickster (Entlarvung eines Bauernfängers)
	> The imagined interiors; static street, dynamic interiors; the revealing smile - a detail that only psychoanalysis or cinema could spot, at least according to Benjamin (cinema taught us how to break a human countenance into its constitutive parts).
11. The spur-of-the-moment stroll (Der Plötzliche Spaziergange)
	> Motion becomes syntax; motion is visual and it becomes syntactic. A sequence of "wenn" subordinates, interrupted by a syntactical variation - "und wenn" - and followed by a symmetrical sequence of "wenn" subordinates; they are again interrupted by "-- dann ist". Syntax is the device which, like vision, allows for motion.
11. Decisions (Entschlüsse)
	> A short vision of social motion and arrest. Again, attention to the micro-gesture (Benjamin). No more to add at this point.
11. The excursion into the mountains (Der Ausflug ins Gebirge)
	> This short direct speech 
11. The trees (Die Bäume)
