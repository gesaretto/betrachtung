# Notes on Betrachtung

__Hypothesis:__ in his work on _Betrachtung_, Kafka is actually trying to translate tropes and devices drawn from film (montage) into syntactic features.

## A list of facts and ideas

1. Betrachtung is a series of 18 short stories written between 1904 and 1912 and published in 1912.
1. Betrachtung means "vision" and, of course, "contemplation"; it is the space between observing and thinking.
1. Here are some observations about each of the short stories:
    1. __Children in the lane__ (Kinder auf der Landstraße):
 > Transference from narrator to subject through sight and perspective; I become you since you I am seeing what you are seeing.
    1. __Unmasking a confidence trickster__ (Entlarvung eines Bauernfängers)
 > The imagined interiors; static street, dynamic interiors; the revealing smile - a detail that only psychoanalysis or cinema could spot, at least according to Benjamin (cinema taught us how to break a human countenance into its constitutive parts).
    1. __The spur-of-the-moment stroll__ (Der Plötzliche Spaziergange)
 > Motion becomes syntax; motion is visual and it becomes syntactic. A sequence of "wenn" subordinates, interrupted by a syntactical variation - "und wenn" - and followed by a symmetrical sequence of "wenn" subordinates; they are again interrupted by "-- dann ist". Syntax is the device which, like vision, allows for motion.
    1. __Decisions__ (Entschlüsse)
 > A short vision of social motion and arrest. Again, attention to the micro-gesture (Benjamin). No more to add at this point.
    1. __The excursion into the mountains__ (Der Ausflug ins Gebirge)
 > This short monologue, the speaker again achieves a sort of visual motion. I believe that, in this case, the effect is accomplished through the use of a spatial preposition - that transparent __ins__. "Natürlich __ins__ Gebirge, wohin denn sonst?" _A possible question_: what would be the most appropriate preposition for _Gebirge_? Wouldn't we say __onto__ and not __into__ the mountains? "Die Hälse werden im Gebirge frei! Es ist ein Wunder, daß wir nicht singen!"
    1. __The bachelor's lot__ (Das Unglück des Junggsellen)
> Combination of the monologue on bizarre habits, the shifts in perspective obtained through reciprocal observations, and the experiments on motion and stasis. Note how reciprocal observations have the tendency to feature a sort of __enframing__ between them: in this case, the open door of the room. The last paragraph is an interesting __volta__, which needs further analysis: is this a sudden embodiment of a fantasy, or a hallucinatory reversal? This is a fully blown experiment on sight, imagination and perception - the final "clap" ("mit der Hand zu schlagen") is an awakening gesture addressed to the reader, as if one had lingered so long in the projection into one's future, that the very projection may suddenly become a fact.
    1. __The businessman__ (Der Kaufmann)
> Well-known mode in Kafka: a monologue about a character who unveils the strangeness of his habits. Very interesting passage on the first page (26) "...all I can do is go home, because my face and hands are soiled and sweaty, my clothes are stained and dusty, I am wearing my working cap, and my boots bear the scratches of packing-case nails. At such times, I walk as if wave-borne, clicking the fingers of both hands and, as children pass, stroking their hair." How can this constitute a first-person perspective? We can see him walking - the detail of his fingers clicking; and then we become him and his hands - we see his hands as if they were ours - as he caresses the child's hair. This is a short story about subjectivity - about seeing oneself: (27) "...I prop myself on my knees to look in the narrow mirror. As the lift begins its ascent I say: Be still all of you, step back, if you will, into the shade of the trees [...] I speak with my teeth." The existence of the mirror - the problem of the mirror - the gaze into the mirror. These spaces, this microscopical spaces of the self, become the immensity { * * * } Contemplation as the observation of the other attempted to become the other, or attempted to better understand the self; the contemplation of the self. __A broader consideration__ this is a book full of _doors_ and _staircases_ (but all of Kafka is); Kafka the collector of dreamscapes. 
    1. __Wool-gathering at the window__ (__Zerstreutes hinausschaun_)
 > A mysterious thing. The attempt to capture an instant is evident - an instant of transition between two irretrievable moments, before and after. **This morning** the sky was *grey*; **now** one is surprised and leans one's cheek against the window catch. The *light of the sun* against a child-like girl. There is, of course, an inversion: we had *shadow* **before**, we have *sunlight* **now**; but the face of the child is *bright* **now** and will be **shadowed** soon - it is being shadowed now by the "man coming up behind her". **Then** the man has gone past, and the child's face is ***really** bright*. We cannot see an important moment - we cannot see the shadow.
        - sky:				
		      - _This morning_	: __grey__
		      - _now_: __sun-light_
	    - child's face
	           - _before_: __bright__
               - _soon?_: __shadowed__
               - _then_: __really__ __bright__ ("das Gesicht des Kindes ist ganz hell")
    1. __The way home__ (Der Nachhausweg)
 > Unbelievably fitting. This is a perfect instance of first person subjective: "I stride along and my speed is the speed ("und mein Tempo ist das Tempo") of this side of the street". Beautiful - how does motion affect, inform this description? How does syntactic - and visual - motion transmit the feeling of "der Luft nach dem Gewitter" (the air after the storm), and the little afterthought of the static room ("ein wenig nachdenklich")? Motion becomes syntax, and it becomes a feeling, an understanding of time.

    1. __The trees__ (Die Bäume)
    1. __Unhappiness__ (Unglücklichsein)
 > Short apparition of a child ghost. Dialogue. Something could be said about how dialogue is antithetical to motion and sight; dialogue as the paralisis of motion and sight - as the embodiment of stasis itself.

##A list of problems
1. What is happening with _photography_? 
> I guess that the real question is: what is Kafka generally doing with __different media__; is he trying to invent a new medium through literature - by exploiting the inherent devices of literature?                         >> My thesis would of course be __yes__.
