The observers go rigid as the train passes by. Die Zuschauer erstarren, wenn der Zug vorbeifährt. The first entrz in Kafka's diaries, like many to follow, is a meditation on vision, and on the effect that vision has on the observer. As it has been noticed, this short description can be easily superimposed with the mythical showing of one of the Lumière brothers' most popular shorts, Arrivée d'un train à la Ciotat, during which the audience notoriously fled from the theater (Duttlinger 37). Kafka's early writings, and his _Diaries_ in particular, constitute an endless sequence of small observations like this one, in which the peculiar relationships that are born between observer and observed are scrutinized and meditated upon. But what is precisely happening in this short, impressive scene? Why do the observers change their state - from what instability - or what ease - do they suddenly acquire that firm posture, do they change their stance by trying not to match the train's motion?
There is one obvious motivation, which is of course consistent with the episode of the projection at the theater where the Lumière were showing their short piece - fear. The spectators of the train passing, running, who are standing in front of it, on what we may assume is little more than a platform, feel fear - their acquired rigidity is a sort of overall step back from the dangerous motion of the train. This foreign, strange motion is the opposite from what they want from themselves - they desire to maintain their position, and therefore they retrocede. Another possibility is a sort of contemplative mode, that the train would suddenly activate - they want to enjoy the spectacle at the best of their capabilities, and therefore they stay rigid not to be distracted from it. There is, eventually, the unconscious engrossing phenomenon of being absorbed by something unknown. There is, finally, the fact that observation is a static activity, a static endeavor. Although the image is animated, the observer has to stand still in order to perceive that animation in full.
Let us think about this more thoroughly. Let us simply picture ourselves there; let us imagine that, instead of standing on the platform, observing the train as it leaves or approaches the station and going rigid, from some subconscious or conscious reason [by the way, another silly reason with which we might anticipate this reflection: the fact that the people observing the train are probably going to step onto it; they hold their luggage, they spy each wagon, each section of the train, peeking through the open windows, in search for an empty spot. It is a very practical endeavor, but it is sort of true; so, in the right order: 1) fear; 2) attention; 3) preliminary to motion; the attentive state that precedes the motion; I am still because I will have to move soon).] - and we were saying that, yes, if we were witnessing the scene ourselves, if we were on the platform and if there was a train moving, approaching or leaving the station, what would happen if, instead of being there and looking at it while standing, we were on board of another train, and if that train were moving at the same speed of the train moving? We would not be able to perceive that movement. The opposition between _repose_ and _motion_ is an opposition that is crucial to the observation of movement. "Erstarren" means to become rigid, and we might picture an overall movement of the body, something happening at the level of the back, of the shoulders, of the head - a sort of petrification; but that is not the only thing that might happen. We might have a simple stop from walking - the passengers were walking, they need to stop in order to see where to get onto the train. _Passenger_ is, nevertheless, the wrong word, the inappropriate word: the problem here is not with a passenger that needs to board a train; the problem, the concern, is observation - better still, spectatorship. These are _Zuschauer_, they are spectators - the automatism that the short sentence describes is the sort of automatism that concerns general problems of vision of a dynamic object - an object moves, and in order to see it moving, I need to stand still, to stay still.
If Kafka had been sitting in that Parisian theater where Ciotat was being shown, he would have probably been more concerned about his observation of the spectators than about the spectacle itself. Kafka would have been looking at the watchers, not at the show.

[This could be kept for the end.] There is, finally, the collocation of this same observation in a diaristic production: Kafka is observing the observers; Kafka is among the spectators of the moving train, but he does not move with them; instead, the exceptionality of this small observation lies precisely in the fact that, as the bystanders on a station platform, we would usually only be looking at the train, and not at the other bystanders; Kafka is the observer observing the observer. More: he registers this small observation in a note that we will read, and the movement of the train, contrasting with the stillness of the observers, will be also contrasting the stillness of our reading practice - on a couch, with an open book in our hands. And more - think about the small dynamic action of writing down this small thought in ink; think about the way in which this contrasts with the stillness of the printed word, and the stillness of the read word. <-__CRUCIAL.__ 

The observations that young Kafka collected in his diaries before 1912, which constitute almost half of his diaristic production as it has survived through the decades for us, have been interpreted as a reflection on the contrasting modes of _film_ and _photography_. Many of them are little experiments in prose, attempts at capturing glimpses of reality, and attempts at capturing glimpses of reality being observed. Critics have interpreted along the dichotomy between _motion_ and _repose_ (Ruhe and Unruhe), which Carolin Duttlinger has especially linked to the opposition between _photography_ (Ruhe) and _film_ (Unruhe), which Kafka would hav initially favored to the earlier. His experiments would have therefore led him to abandon the sort of dynamic acquisition of reality that is peculiar to cinema, in favor of a fragmentation of space in isolated, static images that we can easily relate to photography. Kafka would have abandoned the mode of a frantic registration of motion for a slow juxtaposition of still images.
This dichotomy resolved in a predilection for the latter - photography - is an interesting perspective on his early work. Kafka was certainly both a keen movie-goer and an attentive collector and observer of photographs; his early writings certainly possess a strong visual quality, and they seem peculiarly interested in problems of observation, motion, and stillness. This explorations later converged in his first published book _Betrachtung_, which served as a sort of compilation of his work up to the year 1912. _Betrachtung_ is a de-verbal noun derived from the verb _Betrachten, which means both _view_ and _consider_, a sort of lexical ambiguity that the English word _Observation_ might convey. It is singular in the original: it is a process and a disposition, an attitude that accompanies the writer and the reader through this series of short proses - which are not, by themselves, therefore, _observations_: they are instances of the infinite mode, of the indefinite mode, of _observation_; they could also be considered as _products_ of observation. In this small work, it has been argued, Kafka carefully exploits, explores and resolves his thoughts about the two contrasting media of _film_ and _photography_, finding a solution in the latter.
_Betrachtung_ is therefore a book in which the activity of the writer, and Kafka's diaristic activity, is associated with the mechanical means of reproduction of reality, namely photography and film; it is a book in which these two medias, both their process and their results, are transformed into a literary endeavor. It is therefore appropriate to ask __how__ did the writer manage to materialize this equation: how did the photographic and the filmic process of acquisition of reality translate itself - turn itself into - a literary means? We could add, or better - we could rephrase the question this way: what are the literary means that Kafka uses and analyzes in this small book, as embodiments of the mechanical devices of _film_ and _photography_? Would a specific analysis of this means reveal anything about his approach to these two forms, or would it instead open up the laboratory to wider questions about observation and identity?

[The conventional reading of _Betrachtung_: from the motion of the child on his swing, in the country street, to the repose of the man in bed, in his home in the city.]

The unit of measurement that film and photography have in common is, of course, the _frame_. A frame is a limited portion of reality, captured from a specific point of view, and at a specific time; it is a flattening of the tridimensional experience of space. It features limits that are more immediately explicit than the ones usually perceived by a human being.
Kafka enframes the perspective of his small narrative pieces in a multiplicity of manners in the small collection of _Betrachtung_: literal frames are pervasive. Mirrors are featured prominently in __The businessman__ (Der Kafumann), __Dresses__ (Kleider), and the final short story, __Unhappiness__ (Unglücklichsein); an open door is the frame from which the habits of __The businessman__ (Der Kaufmann) are peered at. Finally, the most pervasive form of literal enframing is certainly the window, from the two short stories that feature it as their central topic, in their title - __Wool-gathering at the window__ (Zerstreutes hinausschaun, literally - watching outside while absent minded) and __The window on the street__ (Das Gassenfenster) - to the uncomforting open window that closes the melancholic __The way home__ (Der Nachhausweg), to the one from which people spy on the young protagonist of __Children on the country street__ (Kinder auf der Landstraße), the first short story of the book. Besides the literal framing motif, this initial piece is in fact exemplary for the rest of the book, providing us with a definite idea of framing and shot.
After an initial aural sensation, the noise of the carts which are heard by the first-person narrator, the first thing that the reader is able to see are _occasional glimpses of them through the shifting gaps in the foliage_ (the German is slightly more explicit: "manchmal sah ich sie auch durch die schwach bewegten Lücken im Laub. (at times I even saw them through the slightly moving gaps in the leaves. This first definition already works as the infinitely small and ephemeral establishment of a _frame_; the peculiarity of this frame, however, is that it is moving, in the same exact way as the object that is being perceived is moving. And yet, we could either understand that the actual spectacle, the cars running on the street, is being partially concealed by a flexible screen, the leaves, or that the combination of the moving leaves, the small shifting gaps, and the flashing cars beyond them is what constitutes a general spectacle for the children; this is a fascinating problematization of our notions of frame and spectacle: we can easily picture the child contemplating the interaction between the leaves and the cars. The essence is that the fixed subject of the sentence, the stable and invisible __Ich__ with which the book opens, is static: the motion belongs to everything that comes after the verb __sah__: the cars are passing by him (vorbeifahren) and the gaps through which they can be perceived are incessantly moving (__bewegten__); the observer is apparently static, the observed is dynamic in front of him. A concept of framing, however problematic, still persists: the cars are seen only occasionally and through the leaves because the subjective, contingent point of view of the child is what needs to be emphasized. We soon discover that the child is sitting on a paradoxically static small swing (_kleinen Schaukel_): it is a further focus on his condition of repose; he could be swinging - is what a child on a swing usually does - but he instead stopped to look through the foliage, or better, to look at the moving foliage through which the cars could be seen. The first sequence of verbs relating to the child, and to the narrator of the collection itself, is an essential definition of the act of _betrachtung_: Ich hörte - sah ich - ich saß - ich ruhte mich. We have therefore discovered the child in a state of fixed observation: he is on his swing, he has the faculty to swing back and forth, to experience the childish frenzy of movement, and instead he hears and looks, sitting and resting in a reposed position. Ruhen is of course the verb absociated to Ruhen, the repose that Duttlinger would immediately associate to photography; and yet, this is the attitude of a movie-goer: we look at the repose of the movie-goer, sitting quietly while observing movement outside; this is not an explicit opposition between photography and film, this is an exploration of the act of observation that, at most, utilizes both the dynamism of cinema and the stasis of photography.
Then, after more contemplation, we suddenly have an inversion in this practice: the child is no longer static, and the swing moves. How? Because a flock of "birds flew up like spray".

> Dann flogen vögel wie sprühend auf, ich folgte ihnen mit den Blicken, sah, wie sie in einem Atemzug stiegen, bis nicht mehr glaubte, daß sie stiegen, sondern, daß ich falle, und fest mich an den Seilen haltend, aus Schwäche ein wenig zu schaukeln anfing. Bald schaukelte ich stärker, als die Luft schon kühler wehte und statt der fliegenden Vögel zitternde Sterne erschienen.

In the first pages of Flaubert's Education Sentimentale, which remained Kafka's favorite novel for a long time (quotation needed), the narrator carefully analyzes the way in which the land is observed by the main character, Fréderic, as he leaves the shores of Paris on a ferry. Notoriously, the description of this departure transfers the motion of the observer to the observed: instead of describing how the vessel runs along the coast, Flaubert makes the coast run along the vessel.

> Insert Flaubert here.

Drawing from this experimental quality of realist fiction, Kafka creates a small, masterful instance of this inversion right in the first page of his first collection.
Panning was extremely rare in early cinema, although some directors were already placing their cameras on flying objects or running trams, in order to register the motion of a point of view together with the motion of the thing observed. Kafka is here slowly introducing us to the potential exhilaration of a moving point of view: the object that the child is trying to follow with his gaze is moving, so that his gaze has to move before that same object leaves the frame. We have no other option but picturing it as an actual enclosed frame: we are placed in the same position as the child, and we know that he won't be able to follow the flight of the flock without moving his eyes, or - probably - even his head. We understand his necessity of using his eyes, of _folgen mit den Blicken_, only if we understand that, if it had remained static, his point of view would have been insufficient. The expression "in einem Atemzug" is literally translated "with one breath", which creates some perplexity: does it mean "in one instant"? And what movement does it qualify, the flight of the birds or the gaze of the child? The German clearly associates it with the plural ascension of the birds - stiegen is a third person plural - but a flock of birds does not have breath, only a child does. Therefore, this motion is transferred from the observed object to the observer, and it instantiates a sort of mirroring movement in the observer and in the observed; the observer moves because the object that he was observing moved. This is different from everything that we have observed so far: it is different from the spectators watching the train and "going rigid", and it is different from what the child was doing at the beginning. By trying to condescend its object, the gaze of the observer reached a point when its object was outside of the frame defined by his point of view, and so it slowly moved to follow it. The flock of bids ascended, reached the limit of the observer's frame, and the gaze of the observer had to move to follow it. This adaptation anticipates a feature that we will examine later, that is the conformation of the observer to its object; and the projective push that an attempt to conform to a thought entails. However, this motion of following the flock reaches a paradox for which the observer has been absorbed by the motion belonging to the observed, which creates a peculiar inversion of perspective: the birds are fixed in the sky, and it is the subject that moves, not the object. This relates to our first hypothesis related to the motion of the train: what if we were sitting on a train while the train was moving, and what if the train on which we were was moving at the same speed as the train which we were looking at? We would not be able to perceive movement any longer. This brief paradox expresses precisely this concern: the birds are now static, and the subject is the one moving; one of the two has to stay fixed, the other has to move. This short paragraph stages precisely this transition: at the very beginning the observer is completely stable, looking at the double movement constituted by the shifting leaves creating mobile gaps against the fence through which running cars are perceivable; then he moves his sight when the birds ascend, so much that he gets the impression that they are fixed, while he is falling; he eventually starts swinging - becoming the mobile element of the equation - when the ascending birds are substituted by fixed, though flickering, stars.

Thus, Kafka defines the observation of movement through the opposition between a static and a moving object. Like in the short line that opens his _diaries_, the observation of motion is deemed impossible from a mobile perspective (hence the paradoxical stasis on the swing); there is then a paradoxical identity between the motion of the observed object and the motion of the gaze, which creates an inversion of perspective: the birds are fixed, the observer is moving - and in two opposite directions. Finally, when the observed object becomes entirely static - such as in the example of the fixed stars in the distant sky, the gaze is moving. In each case, observation is equivalent to motion, either in the observer or in the observed (but not in both). A small additional note: the opposition between "nicht mehr glaubte, daß sie stiegen, sondern, daß ich falle, is intensely subtle, and it probably needs a clarification - it derives from an extremely careful attention to the implications of observation.  It is the establishment, as we have said, of a complete inversion, introduced by the sondern: the subject changes in the same way as the motion described; it is a sort of active/passive dichotomy; or an instance of relativity. "Sondern" is a specifically German connector: differently than "aber", it introduces an opposition that is in complete alternative. It is _either_ one postulation _or_ the other. In synthesis, it is either the observed or the observed that are in motion, or that are perceived as being in motion (which is the same). It creates a sort of mirroring of one of the essential laws of phyisics: to any action corresponds a reaction. In this case, to the perceived act of raising in the air, corresponds a mutual act of _falling_. It is an illusion that is sought after; it precedes the actual motion of the swing, or perhaps it provokes it rather than anticipating it. Let us consider this more thoroughly: the inversion is introduced by a _bis_: until. It is a difference in __quantity__ that becomes a difference in __quality__: the observer is gradually following the birds more and more, _until_ it gets to the point when the motion is inversely transmitted to his subjectivity. We do not know whether the observer is actually moving at this point: he has been following the flock only _mit den Blicken_, with his sight (not even a physical connotation to this element: it's not the eyes or the pupil, it's the _sight_, the _gaze_: nothing else is moving but this silent, almost abstract faculty of his senses. This happens, as we have already seen, _in einem Atemzug_: in a breath, which is the first transference of a subjective - human - quality to the animal collectivity possessing, clearly, no such faculty; it is a second component in our equation: intensity of the movement (_wie sprühend_) and brevity of the contemplation (_in einem Atemzug_), followed by sight, provoke this reciprocal absortion by the watcher. Let us progress: the simple act of watching the flock for a short period of time produces this sort of vertigo - perceptive inversion of the motion, perceptive appropriation of the motion, inverted according to the physical principle of action/reaction; this vertigo provokes the impulse to hold still (_fest mich an den Seilen haltend_), but the immediate consequence is, conversely, one of actual motion. The almost imperceptible attempt to fix the watcher in a stable position is crucial - an attempt to stay still produces, instead, motion on the flexible set of the swing (_ein wenig_). This starts a more intense process of motion, which results in the motion of the watcher opposed to the motion of the object. The final vision is one of motion in stasis - zittern - and not of tremor. It is a masterful moment, which reveals an intense attention to the functioning of observation.

Attention to the dynamics of observation, brought to this extreme of detail, is one aspect of what we would call "framing" in this series of short narratives; as we have seen, the essential concern for Kafka is to show how the act of watching transfers a sensation of motion onto the watcher; and how observation of a mobile object usually produces an immobile observer. Other instances of this notion are frequent in the collection; in the small encounter described in __Passers-by__ (_Die Vorüberlaufenden__), for instance, the accidental spotting of a mysterious man running towards the observer creates a stasis that is framed with an explicit pictorial quality:

> Wenn man in einer Nacht durch eine Gasse spaziergeht, und ein Mann, von weitem schon sichtbar - denn die Gasse vor uns steigt an und es ist Vollmond -, uns entgegenläuft, so werden wir ihn anpacken, selbst wenn er schwach und zerlumpt ist, selbst wenn jemand hinter ihm läuft und schreit, sondern wir werden ihn weiterlaufen lassen.

The identity between the two instances is clear: a man is visible (_sichtbar_) from afar, a fact that is explained by the expansion of the context immediately surrounding him: the full moon and the sloping street, forming an actual frame at his feet and on his head; then the act of running towards us, and our immediate fixedness - we do not reciprocate the moment, because the principle is that we let stasis match motion.
Framing takes different shapes in _Betrachtung_. At times is, for instance, the observation of something that is entirely static, like in the descriptive short prose dedicated to __Dresses__ (_Kleider_): again through a syntactic choice, a relative clause, the closed are separated from the clothed people.

> Oft wenn ich Kleider mit vielfachen Falten, Rüschen und Behängen sehe, die über schönen Körper schön sich legen, dann denke ich, daß sie nicht lange so erhalten bleiben, sondern Falten bekommen [...].

Together with the recurrent "sondern" structure, that here introduces the hypothetical push of imagination which we will explore in the end of our work, the initial inversion is especially noteworthy: "dresses" constitute the direct object of vision, and the direct object of the verbal construction depending on the first person singukar _ich_ [...] _sehe_; included within this large clause, which the initial _Oft_ allows, are the _dresses_ with their characteristic richness: vielfachen Falten, Rüschen und Behängen; the wearers of the dresses, schönen Körper, are relegated to a subordinate phrase. The three features evidently distribute our observation of the object into three distinct frames: _Falten_ (creases) usually enrich the wider portions of a dress, such as the skirt; _ruffles_, or _Rüschen_, are usually positioned around the waist or the neck; _hangings_ [__?__], or _Behängen_, hang from the rims of the sleeves or of the bottom. We have, therefore, three different close-ups, juxtaposed in a quick transition of frames; a succession of stills that creates a perception of movement only through its rythm, a device that is conventional in literature. What matters here is the isolation of the clothing and the subsequent isolation of the details that constitute clothing. This appreciation of fabric is in fact mirrored by a second destructuring of vision, this time related to the wearers:

> Doch sehe ich Mädchen, die wohl schön und vielfach reizende Muskeln und Knöchelchen und gespannte Haut und Massen dünner Haare zeigen [...]

The process of isolation is therefore double: on one side we have the _Kleider_, on the other the _Mädchen_: the clothing and the wearer of the clothing have been separated by a contrasting syntactic chouce, and then subdivided into their constitutive elements. A sort of isomorphic structure is used here: a double isolation, followed by a tripartite deconstruction of the depicted topic. Once again, these are conventional rhetorical structures - ekphrasis in the first instance, the same sort of deconstruction of the female body that would constitute a lyrical blason in the second one; the explicit isolation of each detail, however, is what produces this sensation of a sequence of stills, or close-ups, which could be edited according to a specific rythm. Language is used as a zooming device, or as the chiaroscuro techniques of photography and film: they bring forth a detail while isolating another one; then they are juxtaposed in a sort of rythmical acceleration that produces both an impression of wholeness and an impression of motion.

At times the isolation and juxtaposition of details creates strange effects of proximity and distance, such as in the case of __Window on the street__ (_Das Gassfenster_); this is a small and curious example of what could be considered a literary perception of stereoscopic vision, with its "derangement of the conventional functioning of optical cues" (Crary 86).

> Wer verlassen lebt und sich doch hie und da irgendwo anschließen möchte, wer mit Rücksicht auf die Veränderungen der Tageszeit, der Witterung, der Berufsverhältnisse und dergleichen ohne weiteres irgendeinen beliebigen Arm sehen will, an dem er sich halten könnte, -der wird es ohne ein Gassfenster nicht lange treiben. Und steht es mit ihm so, daß er gar nichts sucht und nur als müder Mann, die Augen auf und ab zwischen Publikum und Himmel, an seine Fensterbrüstung tritt, und er will nicht und hat ein wenig den Kopf zurückgeneigt, so reißen ihn doch unten die Pferde mit in ihr Gefolge von Wagen und Lärm und damit endlich der menschlichen Entracht zu.

The most conspicuous optical alteration of this brief passage consists, of course, in the juxtaposition of the proximity of what the protagonist of the short story actually desires, the __ohne weiteres irgendeinen beliebigen Arm__, and what he actually sees from his window, pushing his own gaze _down under_ - _doch unten_. The first and the second line of the passage create two contrasting spaces: we first picture a window that faces the street _on the level of the street_, that is - at the right height to perceive an arm as if it were immediately close to the observer; then, this window is immediately pushed up, at a level that is instead projected onto the line between the soil and the sky (_zwischen Publikum und Himmel_). As he contemplates what lies very far in the horizon, or down below, the man obtains something that is as close and as tangible as an arm that he could actually reach and feel, or even hang to. We might return to this passage later, when we consider the contradiction between the projection of wish and the sensations offered by reality; in the meanwhile, it is also relevant to notice how the observer - his sight - creates an impossible space by the collation of his projected view and his actual view: it is what Kulesov notoriously suggested cinema could do. It is also important to remark that there is absolutely no human presence in the final lines of the short story - all that this silent man can see are horses, cars, and noise.

This passage will probably deserve a more attentive exploration later. Here it is not very productive.

[REMEMBER that the considerations on the _close-up_ can be associated to what Benjamin has to say about the peculiarities of cinema when they are associated to psychoanalysis.]

The elements that contribute to the idea of _framing_ in the short collection are therefore an explicit attention to the limits and the peculiarities of subjective view, as in the short passage that opens the collection in the story _Kinder auf der Landstrasse_, and an isolation and destructuring of details that creates a sort of rythmical sequence of stills, echoed in the syntactical structure of the descriptions, as in _Kleider). An exemplary combination of both moments consists for sure in the description of the woman that the narrator watches in __The passenger__ (_Der Fahrgast_). The whole short story is an experiment of _stasis_ in motion: like the child on the swing, the narrator is able to convey, and to perceive, a sense of stability while inhabiting an inherently, emphatically mobile setting: his sense of ceaseless movement should be double: on the one hand, he is on board of a tramway car - the soil is moving under his feet, the scenery is moving through the windows; on the other hand, his position is explicitly one of insecurity, existential mobility: the man is _vollständig unsicher in Rücksicht meiner Stellung in dieser Welt, in dieser Stadt, in meiner Familie_. There is a paradoxical inversion between the motion of the vehicle, and of the intellectual perception of what the narrator feels is shifting around him - in the concentrical progression from the world to the city to the family - and the fixedness of his point of view as a narrator. Rightly enough, the character is stable and standing, and it is the world that moves around him; the concentrical climax of this localization conveys the impression of wheels moving fast as they get more and more far from the observer. Everything is moving, except for the narrator - who is located with a stable sequence of spatial prepositions and adverbs "auf dieser Platform, an dieser Schlinge, von diesem Wagen". The sequence, which links together a prepositional adverb and a definite noun, features at its center the parallel succession of three deictics, which emphasize the stable location of the speaker even more - they locate his perspective within a specific contingency, an irrepetible contingency. It is an experiment in perspective, once again; the apex of motion around the observer equals his awareness of his fixedness and indifference to the world. He has become, through his point of view, the invisible axis around which the entire world might be spinning, not requiring anything from him. Notice that the first sequence, the concentrical climax of locations, features the same structure - the platform that sustains the narrator, the loop to which he hangs, the wagon on which he is running. This could even be considered as a climax proceeding in the opposite direction: we first had a motion from the world to the speaker, now we have a motion from the speaker to the world. It is this allineation of deictics and spatial determiners that conveys a sense of his position as a sort of invisible, and somehow indifferent axis. There is more: the move is extremely ambivalent. He is the anonymous passenger, the face in the crowd observed by Baudelaire day by day in his first experiences as a flâneur, and it is at the same time the invisible center of the universe, because we are suddenly approaching his subjectivity. That is, the literal meaning of this short passage seems to convey one sense, whereas the stylistical choices that have been used convey another: through the juxtaposition of sight and motion, the anonymous character has become the axis around which the world is revolving around him. The objective description has been absorbed by his subjectivity - in a sort of imaginary zoom, we have approached him from the remoteness of the world to the intimacy of his family - an invisible setting, a context to which he would be the only one to be completely aware.

The same trajectory from an objective to a subjective description is keenly conveyed in the short description that follows. As this passage closes, and the character perceives that the world is indifferently revolving around him, a lady enters the car.

> Sie ist schwarz gekleidet, die Rockfalten bewegen sich fast nicht, die Bluse ist Knapp und hat einen Kragen aus weißer kleinmaschiger Spitze, die linke Hand hält sie flach and die Wand, der Schirm in ihrer Rechten steht auf der zweiteriobersten Stufe. Ihr Gesicht ist braun, die Nase, an der Seiten schwach gepreßt, schließt rund und breit ab. Sie hat viel braunes Haar und verwehte Härchen an der rechten Schläfe. Ihr kleines Ohr liegt eng an, doch sehe ich, da ich nahe stehe, den ganzen Rücken der rechten Ohrmuschel und den Schatten an der Wurzel.

These two periods create an intensely sensual progression, which brings us nearer to both the intimacy of the observer, and the push, the inner drive of his desire, and the silent intimacy of the observed. The description seems to offer a sort of accelerated progression from the general to the detail, as if the gaze of the narrator were able to circle his object first, and to focus on one specific detail of her body later; it is, however, a very carefully designed motion: the prose construct this transference slowly, through a series of carefully designed frames, which create the impression of a slow adherence of gaze on the body of its object.  The first sentence begins with a full-body frame: we cannot see any specific detail, except for a general observation about the color of the woman's clothes, which are not described, or even mentioned, in their specific features. We only see a sort of black shilouette. The sight of the observer then follows a bottom-to-top progression, from the lower end of the skirt,and its _Rockfalten_, to the blouse, fastened, and the collar, whose top is white striped. The description created a sort of evanescent stasis - it is as if, through the narrator's insistent gaze, erotically charged in this explicit vertical discovery of her body, the woman had left the scene to be inspected within a sort of transcendent space; she becomes, like the main character, surprisingly still - her clothes do not move at all - "bewegen sich fast nicht" - and every detail conveys a perception of fixedness and fastness, including the shirt and the tight collar. In this abstract realm, the figure seems thus to be observable from every angle, so that the imaginary gaze describing her, whose moves are uniform with the breaks and connections of syntax, seems to be able to circle her, to embrace her entirety in a full circle: we therefore move from her left hand, which adheres carefully to the wall, to the umbrella in her right hand, which we follow to the second step (_zweitobersten Stufe_), which supports its weight. The contrast between the two subjects, however, establishes a sort of visual disparity, which seems to restitute the object to a definite perspective. The two hands are juxtaposed on a syntactical level, but they do not occupy the same grammatical space: only the left hand is a grammatical subject, whereas the subject of the second sentence is the same umbrella that leans on the step. Both elements are nevertheless used to convey, again, a sense of transcendent stability - they are secure against the wall, vertically, and on the step, horizontally - or vice versa. This disparity between subjects, however, for which the description insists first on part of the woman's body, then on one of her accessories, seems to suggest a visual disparity: perhaps the narrator is able to see her left hand better than her right hand, and she would therefore be standing in front of him as a sort of slightly tilted side perspective. The opening of the second sentence seems to contradict this statement: the narrator is suddenly capable of looking at her _Gesicht_; but he only focuses on her complexion, giving no detail about her traits other than the shape of her _Nase_, pressed on the sides and round at the tip. The description of her hair is more specific, and stresses only one side of her head, the right one. We slowly understand that the observer is standing in a specific position right now: he has a better access to the left hand, the right temple, and the back of the head, since the hair is described with more accuracy than the visage. The last detail constitutes a coronation of this process of concentration of the narrator's gaze: the parallel hands that were alternatively described in the previous sentence are here matched by an asymmetrical look on _Ihr kleines Ohr_, a single small ear, observed from a specific perspective, existing as if there was no other possible ear. The gaze becomes insistingly singular _doch sehe ich, da ich nach stehe_, and at the same time intensely focused on the most infinitely minute detail, the small shadow at the root of her earshell. From the general outlook on her figure, absorbed in the third person singular of an omniscient narrator, the focus shifted to the most explicitly singular point of view. The dichotomy is understandably between an objective description and a subjective description: the narrator on the one hand and the reality that he can observe on the other. The first few lines of the short story make this anonymous observer the silent axis of his universe; he is the static center of a revolving system of concentrical wheels, which first expand towards him, and then expand directly from him; while his literal thoughts express a sense of loss and superfluity, the style employed reveals that he considers himself, in reality - or that, in reality, the narrator describes him as - the center of the world that he inhabits. Therefore, when in the end the narrator looks at this other passenger and wonders - why are not speaking about yourself, about the wonder of your own appearance? The narrator is wondering about why the object of his contemplation does not become herself a producer of a discourse around herself, like he did; she should simply open her mouth and begin an analogous utterance that centralizes her point of view as the axis around which the world is spinning. This opportunity is, however, denied by the fact that the reality that this _Mädchen_ occupies is, in itself, absorbed by the reality uttered by the narrator: it was only apparently an objective reality, and in fact the product of a subjective gaze on reality. She does not say anything alike, or of the same sort (_dergleichen_) because her reality is incorporated within the observer's reality. The final line is therefore an ultimate assertion of a limit, the limit of the perspective - of the subjective frame - in which the entirety of the observed reality has been enclosed, and which the characters cannot be aware of. The second reason for which the _Mädchen_ cannot utter a discourse around herself, or a discourse that is of the same sort as the one pronounced by the narrator, is that the gaze produced by the narrator is something subjective, not objective; it is something that cannot be understood or perceived by the _Mädchen_. This final example presented all of the most peculiar features of the definition of a frame: it is intensely aware of the characteristic of vision, and of the possible illusions that an awareness of optical devices can produce - in this case the paradoxically static observer placed at the center of an intensely mobile environment, both literally and metaphorically; it is aware of its limits and boundaries, which are explicited in the moment when the gaze of the observer shifts from the shiluette of the woman who enters the tram to the infinitely minute detail of her ear, only accessible to his gaze, and singularly accessible to his gaze; it postulates a dichotomy between a static observer and a mobile observed object, which can occasionally be inverted; it isolates details of the observed object, through the use of a syntactic chiaroscuro techinque that carefully chooses which elements to highlight, or simply light, like in this case the hand. The frame is a consciously limited detail that can be isolated from its context, and that works dynamically in creating a series of optical illusions and plays on the dichotomy between objective and subjective. A frame is, finally, an impressionistic definition of the subjective; differently from Flaubert, Kafka does not shape the entire reality of his narration around the peculiarities of a subjective gaze; he shows the alterations that occur at the level of a single individuality, and plays with the excesses of an individual's vision. His word is not pictorically impressionistic strictu sensu, unlike Flaubert's: the environment does not bend to the gaze of an anonymous observer, such as the narrator, or better, it does not achieve its impressionistic qualities by means of an excessive realism; on the contrary, it stresses subjectivity in a playful manner, it creates an optical illusion around the notions of subjectivity and vision. It is not impressionism as much as it is an optical illusion, like an anamorph from the Early Modern period, changing according to the point of view of the observer.

After framing, a second powerful notion that seems to be present in this early experiments is a certain underdstanding of _editing_. Let us think about the previous examples: in both _Kleider_ and _Der Fahrgast_ an idea of isomorphism and rythm was conveyed by the syntactical structure used for different angles of the description.

Editing, "the most widely discussed film technique", was undergoing an intense process of evolution in this epoch, defining the essential ways in which a story would be designed for, and delivered through, the cinematic medium. Between the beginning of the century and the core of the 1910s, cinema started to understand the ways in which cutting and stitching together different shots could contribute to the illusion of narrative, temporal, and spatial progression. A definite grammar of editing strategies was progressively devised by the early authors of cinema: the way in which connections could be used to enhance or to jeopardize an illusory perception of reality, an element of verisimilitude, was therefore established by the end of this period. As Bordwell explains in his now widespread approach to the subject, editing usually possesses four different functional aspects: it can be used to institute "Graphic relations between shot A and shot B; rythmic relations between shot A and shot B; spatial relations between shot A and shot B, temporal relations between shot A and shot B." Some of this observations on cinema derive, of course, from the way in which written language has been handling with this issues for centuries before the invention of film: film of course inherited this techinques that were already central for the way in which writing organized its narrative structure. The isomorphic graphical relations that two shots can possess in cinema, between two round objects at the center of the screen, for instance, or between two red objects in the upper right corner of the frame, are already present in any rhetorical device that emphasizes the aspect of the signifier to that of the signified, prosodic and metrical recourses such as anaphora, alliteration, or even rhyme. Cinema absorbed and remediated this notions of repetition, and Kafka unsurprisingly reproposes them in the syntactical structuring of these short stories: examples such as the three central deictics in the first part of _Der Fahrgast_ abound in his writing. A rythmical connection is similarly assimilable to metrical patterns, which similarly derived from music.

A clear example of a rythmic acceleration in Kafka's _Betrachtung_ is the short story entitled _The spur-of-the-moment stroll_, or __Der Plötzliche Spaziergange__: in this short piece, the motion that is so peculiar to the collection is conveyed and reproduced by a series of syntactic choices:

> Wenn man sich am Abend endgültig entschlossen zu haben scheint, zu Hause zu bleiben, den Hausrock angezogen hat, nach dem Nachtmahl beim beleuchtetem Tisch sitzt und jene Arbait oder jenes Spiel vorgenommen hat, nach dessen Beendigung man gewohnheitsgemäß schlafen geht, wenn draußen ein unfreundliches Wetter ist, welches das Zuhausebleiben selbverständlich macht, wenn man jetzt auch schon so lange bei Tisch stillgehalten hat, daß Weggehen allgemeines Erstaunen hervorrufen müßte, wenn nun auch schon das Treppenhaus dunkel und das Haustor gesperrt ist, und wenn man nun trozt alledem in einem plötzlichen Unbehagen aufsteht, den Rock wechselt, sofort straßenmäßig angezogen erscheint, weggehen zu müßen erklärt, es nach kurzem Abschied auch tu 

The structure of this short story is articulated around the anaphoric enumeration of the conditions that produce the subitaneity of the same stroll; these conditions are introduced by a series of "wenn" subordinate clauses, which not only create a definite spatial and temporal transition, but define a specific rythimcal pattern. The short prose describes the moment when an anonymous man takes the transforming decision, against sleepiness, habit, and odd weather, to leave his room and his house to enjoy a stroll in the open air. The decision is incapsulated within an elaborate single sentence, introduced by a number of subordinate clauses starting with the subjunctive preposition _wenn_: five before the decision to walk out, and four after it. Each _wenn_ is in fact the definition of a frame: the first one puts the impersonal subject at his table, at evening and after dinner, then a peek at the inclement weather outside, then a peek at the surprised company inside, and at the dark staircase and at the closed door that separate the man from the street. The first five subordinate clauses, therefore, depict a series of frames that are progressively less elaborate, and therefore progressively shorter: it is as if the time devoted to each frame became progressively shorter as the decision to take the stroll becomes progressively clearer: the first subordinate clause, setting the context of the individual sitting at the table, the dress hanging from the coat-hanger, the chair close to the table, the candle lit and a game or a piece of work on the desk, contains a total of four subordinate verbs; the second and the third one, devoted to the inclement weather outside and to the calm company inside, define a parallel subordination of one clause each, the fourth one only a simple third person verb, _ist_. It is a small masterful move: the five subordinate clauses, introduced by _wenn_, that lead to the abrupt decision to leave the house, are progressively shorter and less detailed; the decision is conveyed by a series of five short clauses, and followed by four other subordinates describing the condition of freedom experienced by the subject. The short story is therefore constituted by two symmetrical sequences of progressively shorter conditional subordinates, which are interrupted by a brief description of the actual decision to leave the house. A sense of acceleration is conveyed by the sequence of shorter and shorter clauses, and a sense of liberation and breath by the last ones. The first half of the sentence isolates the main character in a series of progressively shorter and progressively less detailed clauses, which describe his posture at the table, his immediate sorroundings, the weather outside of the window and the company of calm overlookers around him, and it briefly closes on the obstacles that separate the the character from the sudden impulse to leave, suggesting a sense of entrapment and uneasiness. They describe the objective condition of stasis in which the character finds himself: he is captured within a setting of habitual gestures and poses, by what is externally expected from him, and therefore the frames and the succession of shots progressively leaves his point of view to focus on the details that separate him from the assumed freedom constituted by the outside world; they are a series of static portraits describing his objective position in space and the habitual expectations that his sorroundings might have about him. The style of the narration, however, and the syntactic choices used to convey this sense of enclosure, support an opposite feeling of dynamism and focus, which is then matched by the sequence of sudden, brief decisions used to grasp and express his liberation; the sense that the _volta_ wishes to convey is, appropriately, one of abruptness and antithesis; the clauses become shorter immediately after the decision, and the number of words separating each verb from each other becomes smaller; it is a more concitate, more explicit rythm the one that brings the actor to the sudden, and subjective, resolution to motion; after having pushed him outisde, this motion finally reaches his intimacy and his satisfaction at the decision that he has taken: the subsequent set of frames are no longer visual, but instead depict an inner condition of self-reliance and positive determination, ending in the expectancy, the infinite promise of the open - with the last short clause of the section, __und wenn__ _man so die langen Gassen hinläuft_, hurrying along the infinite street that lies open in front of him. We are concerned, here, with the contrast between the literal sense of the first few clauses and the sense of acceleration implied in the visual aspect of framing and syntax. The first half of the prose, leading to the sudden decision, is what matters the most to our analysis.

Syntactical density often conveys this sense of rythm: shorter subordinate clauses have, as a consequence, a shorter distance between each verb; together with the visual aspect of the frames, which carefully define a dichotomy between objective reality and subjective perception, and which bring the point of view either closer to or further from the character or the narrator, these stylistical choices often contradict the literal content of a short story, creating unexpected impressions of motion or stasis, that might suit or not the actual content of a story.

The way home (__Der Nachhausweg__) seems to be an experiment in the coexistence of framing and editing in the definition of a subjective rythm that might contrast with the actual rythm of objective reality. In the short story, a stroller is watching the changing context that surrounds him. It is an explicit experiment in cinematic perspective, one where the contrast between literal meaning and the force of stylistic choices is perhaps less perceivable, but a substantial one nevertheless.

> Ich marschiere und mein Tempo ist das Tempo dieser Gassenseite, dieser Gasse, dieses Viertels. Ich bin mit Recht verantwortlich für alle Schläge gegen Türen, auf die Platten der Tische, für alle Trinksprüche, für die Liebespaare in ihren Betten, in den Gerüsten der Nebauten, in dunklen Gassen an die Häusermauer gepreßt, auf den Ottomanen der Bordelle.

The first observation that we can make about this short passage is that, again, motion belongs to the observer and not to the observed object. This discrepancy is the radical element of Kafka's prose at this moment, the one which would make us propend for a reading of this collection that privileges cinema to photography: photography, both in its perusal and in its actual production, involves to still subjects, an observer and an observed object that stay perfectly still. It is impossible that the fixed machine of the photographic camera can actually absorb movement: it cannot move while working, and its subject must stay still to be photographed. Film, on the other hand, always implies this dichotomy: the camera might be moving, or the observed object might be moving; when experienced, cinema is always experienced by a fixed observer watching a dynamic spectacle placed in front of him or her. The same is happening here, like in the first line of Kafka's diaries: the __Tempo__ that the observer is able to project against the objects perceived during his march is not the _Tempo_ of their actual activity, but the _Tempo_ of their rapid succession in time, produced by his own movement. All of the objects that the observer describes are perfectly still, their motion is only existent in the succession allowed by syntactic structuring, punctuation, and juxtaposition. There is no verb in these objective phrases: they constitute fixed stills in time and space, tied together by their alternation and the careful adjectivation and system of prepositions that frame them. They are static objects existing in space, defined first by three deictic adjectives, then by three prepositions introduced by _für_, finally by three spatial complements introduced by _in_ and _auf_. The subjectivity of the narrator rythmically embraces each of its objects, absorbing them into a rapid impressionistic sequence.

A similar example, explored by _Duttlinger_ in her chapter on the collection in her __Introduction__, is _Wanting to be a Red Indian_ (Wunsch, Indianer zu werden): the short piece presents again an acceleration conveyed by a sequence of pictorial frames segmented by parallel syntactical choices: like the _Spur-of-the-moment stroll_, it begins with the conditional "Wenn", which is amplified in a series of short clauses which temporarily suspend the resolution of the condition, creating an impression of suspense and acceleration, which is followed by two symmetrical alternatoons between a "bis man" and a "denn es gab", and that is concluded by an "und kaum".
