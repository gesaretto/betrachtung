# Notes on Betrachtung

## A list of facts and ideas

1. Betrachtung is a series of 18 short stories written between 1904 and 1912 and published in 1912.
1. Betrachtung means "vision" and, of course, "contemplation"; it is the space between observing and thinking.
1. Here are some observations about each of the short stories:
	1. __Children in the lane__ (Kinder auf der Landstraße):
		 >> Transference from narrator to subject through sight and perspective; I become you since you I am seeing what you are seeing.
	1. __Unmasking a confidence trickster__ (Entlarvung eines Bauernfängers)
		 >> The imagined interiors; static street, dynamic interiors; the revealing smile - a detail that only psychoanalysis or cinema could spot, at least according to Benjamin (cinema taught us how to break a human countenance into its constitutive parts).
	1. __The spur-of-the-moment stroll__ (Der Plötzliche Spaziergange)
		 >> Motion becomes syntax; motion is visual and it becomes syntactic. A sequence of "wenn" subordinates, interrupted by a syntactical variation - "und wenn" - and followed by a symmetrical sequence of "wenn" subordinates; they are again interrupted by "-- dann ist". Syntax is the device which, like vision, allows for motion.
	1. __Decisions__ (Entschlüsse)
		 >> A short vision of social motion and arrest. Again, attention to the micro-gesture (Benjamin). No more to add at this point.
	1. __The excursion into the mountains__ (Der Ausflug ins Gebirge)
		 >> This short direct speech ---
	1. __Wool-gathering at the window__ (INSERT GERMAN)
		 >> A mysterious thing. The attempt to capture an instant is evident - an instant of transition between two irretrievable moments, before and after. **This morning** the sky was *grey*; **now** one is surprised and leans one's cheek against the window catch. The *light of the sun* against a child-like girl. There is, of course, an inversion: we had *shadow* **before**, we have *sunlight* **now**; but the face of the child is *bright* **now** and will be **shadowed** soon - it is being shadowed now by the "man coming up behind her". **Then** the man has gone past, and the child's face is ***really** bright*. We cannot see an important moment - we cannot see the shadow.
